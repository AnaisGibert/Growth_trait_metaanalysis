The aim of this study was to evaluate photosynthetic parameters and growth in seedlings of Bertholletia excelsa and Carapa guianensis in response to pre-acclimation to full sunlight and mild water stress. I used six independent pre-acclimation treatments (0, 90 (11h15-12h45), 180 (10h30-13h30), 360 (09h00-15h00), 540 (07h30-16h30) and 720 min (06h00-18h00)) varying the time of exposure to full sunlight (PFS) during 30 days, followed by whole-day outdoor exposure for 120 days. Before PFS, the plants were kept in a greenhouse at low light levels (0.8 mol m(-2) day(-1)). The PFS of 0 min corresponded to plants constantly kept under greenhouse conditions. From the beginning to the end of the experiment, each PFS treatment was submitted to two water regimes: moderate water stress (MWS, pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(L)) of -500 to -700 kPa) and without water stress (WWS, Psi(L) of-300 kPa, soil kept at field capacity). Plants under MWS received only a fraction of the amount of water applied to the well-watered ones. At the end of the 120-day-period under outdoor conditions, I evaluated light saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E) and plant growth. Both A(max) and g(s) were higher for all plants under the PFS treatment. Stem diameter growth rate and A(max) were higher for C. guianensis subjected to MWS than in well-watered plants. The contrary was true for B. excelsa. The growth of seedlings was enhanced by exposure to full sunlight for 180 minutes in both species. However, plants of B. excelsa were sensitive to moderate water stress. The higher photosynthetic rates and faster growth of C. guianensis under full sun and moderate water stress make this species a promissory candidate to be tested in reforestation programs.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0044-5967;;WOS:000327804500007;

Light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)) and light saturation estimates (LSE) reflected the species successional status with Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels, the pioneer species showing largest mean Amax and LSE at 100% sunlight, whereas at 10% sunlight, it showed the lowest A(max) and LSE. At 22% sunlight, Cedrela odorata L., an intermediate successional species had greater Amax and LSE than Mansonia altissima A. Chev., a non-pioneer light demander and T. superba. T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A(max)-mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F-v/F-m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species' short-term acclimation to high or low light.

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.;;;;;;;;;41;1;45;0;46;0028-646X;;WOS:000186322000006;

One month before transplanting, the seedlings were assigned to fertilized or nutrient-deprived treatments. Immediately after transplanting, half the seedlings in each nutrient treatment were placed in shadecloth tree shelters. The experimental site was at an altitude of 700 m, which is considered marginal for the establishment of E. nitens plantations in Tasmania because of low mean annual minimum temperatures.Overnight frosts followed by sunny morning conditions in the first 20 weeks after transplanting (early June to early October) caused severe photoinhibition. Predawn maximal photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)) Were depressed in nutrient-deprived seedlings compared with fertilized seedlings, although shading partially alleviated this difference. Neither F-v/F-m nor A(max) recovered to values observed before transplanting until > 20 weeks after transplanting. During this period, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was high in seedlings in all treatments, although NPQ was lower in shaded, fertilized seedlings than in seedlings in the other treatments.Total foliar nitrogen (N) concentration increased up to 42 weeks after transplanting in the nutrient-deprived seedlings in parallel with increasing relative growth rate (RGR). Fractionation of N- and phosphorus (P)-containing compounds indicated that differences in protein N accounted for the treatment differences in total seedling N. Nucleic acid P increased and inorganic P decreased during growth periods, although total seedling P remained constant. Among treated seedlings, height growth was greatest in shaded seedlings: this was probably a result of apical dominance effects because RGR was higher in unshaded seedlings than in shaded seedlings. Thus, the shade treatment alleviated chilling-dependent photoinhibition and maximized growth during winter, but limited growth during warmer periods and therefore overall growth.;;;;;;;;;13;0;10;2;14;0829-318X;;WOS:000181841200001;12566257

The objective of the study was to assess the potential of the species for growth under forest canopies and to identify their habitat preferences. The light regimes were created using shade cloth and the) corresponded with deep forest understoreys (2% of the light in the open gap); moderate shade (10%), slight shade as is found in edges of forest gaps (20%) and 100% representing open gaps. Seedling biomass was significantly influenced by light regimes for all species as were total leaf area and relative growth rate. H. abyssinica had the highest growth rate but the lowest survival rate in shade. There was a consistent trend for higher specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) at lower growth light regimes in O. europea and P. falcatus. O. europea and P. falcatus had similar allocation patterns whereby between 20-40% of the total biomass uas allocated to stem, 20-30% to roots and 50-60% to leaves. In H. abyssinica up to 80% was allocated to leaves and only a small percentage to stem and to roots.Within species there were significant differences in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area among the plants grown at the lowest light level and in the open. For plants grown in the open there were ver): little among species differences in A,,,, per unit area. However, there were significant differences in the ii,,, of the different species grown at the lowest light level. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements indicated that open-grown P. falcatus and O. europea experienced moderate photoinhibition. From the growth and photosynthesis results P. falcatus and O. europea appeared to be non-pioneer, shade-tolerant species, while J. procera and to a larger extent H. abyssinica showed pioneer, light-demanding characteristics.

We hypothesized that functional guilds of species, grouped by successional status, would differ in photosynthetic performance and that pioneers would be more sensitive to seasonality and more variable in response to light than intermediate or shade tolerants. Steady-state leaf-level photosynthesis (A) was measured in situ on eight trees per species. Light response curves were generated by fitting a hyperbolic model to these data. Average light saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) were then calculated for each species. Variability of light, photosynthesis, and leaf characteristics were quantified using coefficients of variation (CV). Significant differences were detected among species and functional groups for A, A(max), and leaf N concentration. Functional group explained 46% of the observed variation in A. Pioneers exhibited higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates than intermediates; both were higher than shade tolerants. Intermediates were the most seasonally plastic group and had the highest leaf N concentration. Shade tolerants were found in lower, more variable light environments than pioneers. A strong positive correlation between diameter growth rate and photosynthetic rate (r(2) = 0.55, p = 0.004) was observed across species. Our results tend to confirm the hypothesis that physiological traits can be used to differentiate among functional groups of plants.

Expanding leaves maintained high rates of A(area) but due to high growth respiration rates, net CO2 fixation occurred only at irradiances >200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). We found that full structural leaf development is not a necessary prerequisite for maintaining positive CO2 balance in young birch leaves. Maximum rates of A(area) were realized in late June and early July, whereas the highest values of A(mass) occurred in May and steadily declined thereafter. The maintenance respiration rate averaged approximate to 8 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1), whereas growth respiration varied between 0 and 65 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). After reaching its lowest point in mid-June, leaf respiration increased gradually until the end of the growing season. Mass and area-based dark respiration were significantly positively correlated with LMA at stages of leaf maturity, and senescence. Concentrations of P and K decreased during leaf development and stabilized or increased during maturity, and concentrations of immobile elements such as Ca, Mn and B increased throughout the growing season. Identification of interrelations between leaf development, CO2 exchange, TNC and leaf nutrients allowed us to define factors related to ontogenetic variation in leaf-level physiological traits and can be helpful in establishing periods appropriate for sampling birch leaves for diagnostic purposes such as assessment of plant and site productivity or effects of biotic or abiotic factors.;;;;;;;;;31;0;29;0;32;0931-1890;;WOS:000086380200005;

Gas exchange is strongly seasonal in temperate deciduous forests; however, virtually no studies have described measurements made at the leaf scale through the whole growing season. This level of detail is important to understanding processes as substantial differences may occur within the canopy between species and between sun and shade leaves.2. Gas exchange was measured weekly throughout the growing season in leaves of Oak (Quercus robur) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) trees at Wytham Woods, UK. In Q. robur sun, shade and intermediate leaves were sampled on each occasion.3. Acer pseudoplatanus came into leaf before Q. robur and commenced net assimilation (A) earlier. Maximum irradiance saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) in Q. robur were reached approximately 50 days after budburst and were maintained until approximately 20 days before abscission. Acer pseudoplatanus lost its leaves before Q. robur in the autumn and showed no seasonal trend in A(max). The lag between budburst and attainment of maximum photosynthetic rate in Q. robur was substantial and represented a quarter of the potential growing season.4. A(max) of A. pseudoplatanus (3.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) sun leaves was substantially lower than that of Q. robur (10.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) despite A. pseudoplatanus being a fast-growing species. The earlier flushing of A. pseudoplatanus leaves in the spring could not completely compensate for this. It is likely that other variables, such as total leaf area, are responsible for the high growth rate of A. pseudoplatanus, rather than high photosynthetic rates.5. Shade leaves of Q. robur had lower A(max) and mean A than sun leaves; their quantum efficiency was also lower. Consistent with this, sun leaves had a higher nitrogen content per unit area, resulting from a lower specific leaf area (SLA).6. Week to week variations in solar radiation influenced A; this could be described by a non-rectangular hyperbola. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased in conditions of high vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, this did not decrease A as high VPD was associated with high solar radiation and the stimulation of photosynthesis caused by high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) more than compensated for the reduction by VPD.";;;;;;;;;49;3;43;0;52;0269-8463;;WOS:000081534300006;

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.";;;;;;;;;46;3;45;0;50;d_c-58;;WOS:000076300200007;

There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature.2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates.3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.;;;;;;;;;125;11;126;1;143;0269-8463;;WOS:000076276900009;

We studied ten species, which differed by 30-fold in relative growth rate (RGR). We analyzed plant growth in two contrasting light levels during 52 days and two transfers: from high to low (HL) and from low to high (LH) light intensity, and the respective controls in high (HH) and low (LL) light for another 52 days. The photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance were measured at the day of the transfer between light conditions and at the end of the experiment. Species with high RGR showed the largest changes in RGR in response to contrasting light conditions (HH/LL ratio), and species with low RGR showed low responses. The fast-growing species were the most plastic, followed by species with intermediate growth rates, with the slow-growing species being the least plastic. Fast-growing species achieved higher maximum photosynthetic capacities (A(max)) and stomatal conductance and higher response to light than slow-growing species. Species with high RGR showed a low RGR HH/LH ratio, suggesting a large response of L plants when transfered to H. The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35-75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpinia eriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendron mexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.";;;;;;;;;44;5;46;1;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000071009200006;
Aarea;J;"REICH, PB; WALTERS, MB; ELLSWORTH, DS";;;;;;;;LEAF LIFE-SPAN IN RELATION TO LEAF, PLANT, AND STAND CHARACTERISTICS AMONG DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS;;;;;;;;ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS;;;;62;3;;;365;392;;10.2307/2937116;;;sept-92;1992;Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance. Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns.Among all species, both mass- (A(mass)) and area-based (A(area)) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.70) than an area (P < .05, r2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N(mass)) decreased (P < .001, r2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N(area)) did not (P > .25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A(mass) with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N(mass) and SLA on A(mass). Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, N(mass), and A(mass)) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A(mass) was a linear function of N(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A(area) was not significantly related to N(area). These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis.Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and A(mass)(r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A(mass) and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with A(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N(mass), SLA, LAR, and A(mass) interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals.These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P < .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A(mass), N(mass), and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaflife-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span.We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, SLA, leaf N(mass), A(mass), and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as causally interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.;;;;;;;;;807;62;763;7;900;d_c-15;;WOS:A1992JJ41600003;

The aim of this study was to evaluate photosynthetic parameters and growth in seedlings of Bertholletia excelsa and Carapa guianensis in response to pre-acclimation to full sunlight and mild water stress. I used six independent pre-acclimation treatments (0, 90 (11h15-12h45), 180 (10h30-13h30), 360 (09h00-15h00), 540 (07h30-16h30) and 720 min (06h00-18h00)) varying the time of exposure to full sunlight (PFS) during 30 days, followed by whole-day outdoor exposure for 120 days. Before PFS, the plants were kept in a greenhouse at low light levels (0.8 mol m(-2) day(-1)). The PFS of 0 min corresponded to plants constantly kept under greenhouse conditions. From the beginning to the end of the experiment, each PFS treatment was submitted to two water regimes: moderate water stress (MWS, pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(L)) of -500 to -700 kPa) and without water stress (WWS, Psi(L) of-300 kPa, soil kept at field capacity). Plants under MWS received only a fraction of the amount of water applied to the well-watered ones. At the end of the 120-day-period under outdoor conditions, I evaluated light saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E) and plant growth. Both A(max) and g(s) were higher for all plants under the PFS treatment. Stem diameter growth rate and A(max) were higher for C. guianensis subjected to MWS than in well-watered plants. The contrary was true for B. excelsa. The growth of seedlings was enhanced by exposure to full sunlight for 180 minutes in both species. However, plants of B. excelsa were sensitive to moderate water stress. The higher photosynthetic rates and faster growth of C. guianensis under full sun and moderate water stress make this species a promissory candidate to be tested in reforestation programs.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0044-5967;;WOS:000327804500007;

Light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)) and light saturation estimates (LSE) reflected the species successional status with Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels, the pioneer species showing largest mean Amax and LSE at 100% sunlight, whereas at 10% sunlight, it showed the lowest A(max) and LSE. At 22% sunlight, Cedrela odorata L., an intermediate successional species had greater Amax and LSE than Mansonia altissima A. Chev., a non-pioneer light demander and T. superba. T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A(max)-mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F-v/F-m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species' short-term acclimation to high or low light.

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.;;;;;;;;;41;1;45;0;46;0028-646X;;WOS:000186322000006;

One month before transplanting, the seedlings were assigned to fertilized or nutrient-deprived treatments. Immediately after transplanting, half the seedlings in each nutrient treatment were placed in shadecloth tree shelters. The experimental site was at an altitude of 700 m, which is considered marginal for the establishment of E. nitens plantations in Tasmania because of low mean annual minimum temperatures.Overnight frosts followed by sunny morning conditions in the first 20 weeks after transplanting (early June to early October) caused severe photoinhibition. Predawn maximal photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)) Were depressed in nutrient-deprived seedlings compared with fertilized seedlings, although shading partially alleviated this difference. Neither F-v/F-m nor A(max) recovered to values observed before transplanting until > 20 weeks after transplanting. During this period, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was high in seedlings in all treatments, although NPQ was lower in shaded, fertilized seedlings than in seedlings in the other treatments.Total foliar nitrogen (N) concentration increased up to 42 weeks after transplanting in the nutrient-deprived seedlings in parallel with increasing relative growth rate (RGR). Fractionation of N- and phosphorus (P)-containing compounds indicated that differences in protein N accounted for the treatment differences in total seedling N. Nucleic acid P increased and inorganic P decreased during growth periods, although total seedling P remained constant. Among treated seedlings, height growth was greatest in shaded seedlings: this was probably a result of apical dominance effects because RGR was higher in unshaded seedlings than in shaded seedlings. Thus, the shade treatment alleviated chilling-dependent photoinhibition and maximized growth during winter, but limited growth during warmer periods and therefore overall growth.;;;;;;;;;13;0;10;2;14;0829-318X;;WOS:000181841200001;12566257

The objective of the study was to assess the potential of the species for growth under forest canopies and to identify their habitat preferences. The light regimes were created using shade cloth and the) corresponded with deep forest understoreys (2% of the light in the open gap); moderate shade (10%), slight shade as is found in edges of forest gaps (20%) and 100% representing open gaps. Seedling biomass was significantly influenced by light regimes for all species as were total leaf area and relative growth rate. H. abyssinica had the highest growth rate but the lowest survival rate in shade. There was a consistent trend for higher specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) at lower growth light regimes in O. europea and P. falcatus. O. europea and P. falcatus had similar allocation patterns whereby between 20-40% of the total biomass uas allocated to stem, 20-30% to roots and 50-60% to leaves. In H. abyssinica up to 80% was allocated to leaves and only a small percentage to stem and to roots.Within species there were significant differences in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area among the plants grown at the lowest light level and in the open. For plants grown in the open there were ver): little among species differences in A,,,, per unit area. However, there were significant differences in the ii,,, of the different species grown at the lowest light level. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements indicated that open-grown P. falcatus and O. europea experienced moderate photoinhibition. From the growth and photosynthesis results P. falcatus and O. europea appeared to be non-pioneer, shade-tolerant species, while J. procera and to a larger extent H. abyssinica showed pioneer, light-demanding characteristics.

Steady-state leaf-level photosynthesis (A) was measured in situ on eight trees per species. Light response curves were generated by fitting a hyperbolic model to these data. Average light saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) were then calculated for each species. Variability of light, photosynthesis, and leaf characteristics were quantified using coefficients of variation (CV). Significant differences were detected among species and functional groups for A, A(max), and leaf N concentration. Functional group explained 46% of the observed variation in A. Pioneers exhibited higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates than intermediates; both were higher than shade tolerants. Intermediates were the most seasonally plastic group and had the highest leaf N concentration. Shade tolerants were found in lower, more variable light environments than pioneers. A strong positive correlation between diameter growth rate and photosynthetic rate (r(2) = 0.55, p = 0.004) was observed across species.

Expanding leaves maintained high rates of A(area) but due to high growth respiration rates, net CO2 fixation occurred only at irradiances >200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). We found that full structural leaf development is not a necessary prerequisite for maintaining positive CO2 balance in young birch leaves. Maximum rates of A(area) were realized in late June and early July, whereas the highest values of A(mass) occurred in May and steadily declined thereafter. The maintenance respiration rate averaged approximate to 8 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1), whereas growth respiration varied between 0 and 65 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). After reaching its lowest point in mid-June, leaf respiration increased gradually until the end of the growing season. Mass and area-based dark respiration were significantly positively correlated with LMA at stages of leaf maturity, and senescence. Concentrations of P and K decreased during leaf development and stabilized or increased during maturity, and concentrations of immobile elements such as Ca, Mn and B increased throughout the growing season. Identification of interrelations between leaf development, CO2 exchange, TNC and leaf nutrients allowed us to define factors related to ontogenetic variation in leaf-level physiological traits and can be helpful in establishing periods appropriate for sampling birch leaves for diagnostic purposes such as assessment of plant and site productivity or effects of biotic or abiotic factors.;;;;;;;;;31;0;29;0;32;0931-1890;;WOS:000086380200005;

Gas exchange is strongly seasonal in temperate deciduous forests; however, virtually no studies have described measurements made at the leaf scale through the whole growing season. This level of detail is important to understanding processes as substantial differences may occur within the canopy between species and between sun and shade leaves.2. Gas exchange was measured weekly throughout the growing season in leaves of Oak (Quercus robur) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) trees at Wytham Woods, UK. In Q. robur sun, shade and intermediate leaves were sampled on each occasion.3. Acer pseudoplatanus came into leaf before Q. robur and commenced net assimilation (A) earlier. Maximum irradiance saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) in Q. robur were reached approximately 50 days after budburst and were maintained until approximately 20 days before abscission. Acer pseudoplatanus lost its leaves before Q. robur in the autumn and showed no seasonal trend in A(max). The lag between budburst and attainment of maximum photosynthetic rate in Q. robur was substantial and represented a quarter of the potential growing season.4. A(max) of A. pseudoplatanus (3.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) sun leaves was substantially lower than that of Q. robur (10.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) despite A. pseudoplatanus being a fast-growing species. The earlier flushing of A. pseudoplatanus leaves in the spring could not completely compensate for this. It is likely that other variables, such as total leaf area, are responsible for the high growth rate of A. pseudoplatanus, rather than high photosynthetic rates.5. Shade leaves of Q. robur had lower A(max) and mean A than sun leaves; their quantum efficiency was also lower. Consistent with this, sun leaves had a higher nitrogen content per unit area, resulting from a lower specific leaf area (SLA).6. Week to week variations in solar radiation influenced A; this could be described by a non-rectangular hyperbola. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased in conditions of high vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, this did not decrease A as high VPD was associated with high solar radiation and the stimulation of photosynthesis caused by high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) more than compensated for the reduction by VPD.";;;;;;;;;49;3;43;0;52;0269-8463;;WOS:000081534300006;

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.";;;;;;;;;46;3;45;0;50;d_c-58;;WOS:000076300200007;

This function, known as an environmental filter, varies in space and affects community composition. However, filters are poorly characterized because dispersal patterns can obscure environmental effects, and few studies utilize longitudinal data linking individual performance to environment. We model the effects of environmental filters on demographic rates of nearly all tree species (99) in a 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of environmental filtering, drawing inspiration from classic studies of intraspecific natural selection. We characterize the specific environmental gradients and trait axes most important in filtering of demographic rates across species. We found that stronger filtering along a given trait axis corresponded to less spatial variation in the value of favoured traits. Environmental gradients associated with filtering were different for growth versus survivorship. Species maximum height was under the strongest filtering for growth, with shorter species favoured on convex ridges. Shorter stature species may be favoured on ridges because trees on ridges experience higher wind damage and lower soil moisture. Wood density filtering had the strongest effects on survival. Steep slopes and high available P in the soil favoured species with low-density wood. Such sites may be favourable for fast-growing species that exploit resource-rich environments. Synthesis: We characterized trait-mediated environmental filters that may underlie spatial niche differentiation and life-history trade-offs, which can promote species coexistence. Filtering along trait axes with the strongest effects on local community composition, that is, traits with the strongest filtering, may necessarily have a weaker potential to promote species coexistence across the plot. The weak spatial variation in filters with strong effects on demography may result from long-term processes affecting the species pool that favour habitat generalist strategies.;;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0022-0477;;WOS:000318186800018;

Following centuries of severe deforestation, reforestation with this native species was conducted in the Atiquipa lomas, Arequipa-Peru. On five slopes, five 2-year-old seedlings were irrigated monthly with water trapped by raschel-mesh fog collectors, supplementing natural rainfall with 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm month(-1) from February to August 2008. We measured plant growth, increment in basal diameter, height and five leaf traits: leaf mass area (LMA), leaf carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C), nitrogen per leaf area, total leaf carbon and stomatal density; which are indicative of the physiological changes resulting from increased water supply. Plant growth rates, estimated from the variation of either shoot basal diameter or maximum height, were highly correlated with total biomass. Only LMA and delta(13)C were higher in irrigated than in control plants, but we found no further differences among irrigation treatments. This threshold response suggests an on-off strategy fitted to exploit pulses of fog water, which are always limited in magnitude in comparison with natural rain.

These data were used to test whether genome size was significantly different for invasive (n = 21; species known to be established and spreading in foreign environments) and non-invasive (n = 71; species that have been introduced to foreign environments but which are not known to be spreading) species. Data for five functional traits [seed mass, specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum height and dispersal mode] and three characteristics of native range (size, temperature range and precipitation range) were used to test for univariate and multivariate relationships between (1) invasiveness and traits and (2) genome size and traits.Results Genome size ranged from 1.20 to 2.13 pg/2C and was not significantly smaller in invasive compared with non-invasive acacias. However, invasive acacias were found to be taller and possess a larger native range size and a wider range of annual precipitation when compared with non-invasive acacias. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between invasive and non-invasive acacias (PERMANOVA; P < 0.01) driven largely by differences in native range characteristics. We detected a positive relationship between genome size and SLA (P = 0.02) and elaiosome dispersal mode (P < 0.01) in analyses across species, but these findings were not supported by evolutionary divergence analyses.Main conclusions Genome size variation does not underpin variation in traits associated with the invasive/non-invasive dichotomy in introduced acacias, probably because of the very small DNA values in the Acacia species studied. Acacias introduced into new environments are most likely to become invasive if they are tall shrubs or trees and are widely distributed in their native range.";;;;;;;;;18;0;18;0;18;1366-9516;;WOS:000294655400009;

Tree allometry often varies among coexisting species of different maximum height (H(max)) in forests. Although shoot growth patterns directly influence overall tree architecture, the structures of current-year shoots at the tops of crowns have not been directly related to differences in tree allometry across species.2. I investigated height-dependent changes in structure and biomass allocation patterns in current-year shoots of four coexisting tree species differing in H(max) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The relative importance of total biomass, biomass allocation, shoot allometry, and shoot angle to vertical growth was quantified and compared with tree allometry.3. Height-dependent changes in total biomass of current-year shoots varied across species. In contrast, stem length per unit mass, shoot angle, and total leaf area per unit stem cross-sectional area decreased, and leaf mass per unit area increased with height in all species. Vertical growth rate consequently declined with increasing height in all species. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the primary determinant of declining vertical growth rate was change in stem length per unit mass; shoot angle was a secondary determinant. In contrast, increases in total shoot mass with height modulated declining vertical growth rates.4. Vertical growth rate was greater in two canopy species than in two sub-canopy species at given heights at the shoot level, and this pattern coincided with allometry between tree height and trunk diameter. In contrast, vertical growth rate was greater in sub-canopy species than in canopy species near their maximum heights. These patterns suggest that allometric differences between species may be useful for evaluating crown-development patterns, but not for estimating H(max) of species.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0269-8463;;WOS:000292330000006;

Average treetop sap velocity (V(S)), transpiration per unit leaf area (E(L)) and stomatal conductance per unit leaf area (G(S)) significantly decreased with increasing height. These differences in sap flow were associated with an unexpected decrease in treetop sapwood area-to-leaf area ratios (A(S):A(L)) in the tallest trees. Both E(L) and G(S) declined as soil moisture decreased and vapor pressure deficit (D) increased throughout the growing season with a greater decline in shorter trees.

The close relationship we observed between G(Sref) and -delta is consistent with the role of stomata in regulating E(L) and leaf water potential (Psi(L)).

Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;14;0;14;0;14;0021-8901;;WOS:000279405100012;

Wood density is considered a key functional trait influencing the growth and survival of woody plants and has been shown to be related to a slow-fast rate-of-living continuum. Wood density is, however, an emergent trait arising from several vascular properties of wood, including the diameter and frequency of xylem conduits.2. We aimed to test the hypotheses that there is a set of inter-related trade-offs linked to the different functions of wood, that these trade-offs have direct consequences for tree growth and survival and that these trade-offs underlie the observed correlations between wood density and demographic rates. We evaluated the covariation between xylem anatomical traits among woody species of New Zealand and whether that covariation had the potential to constrain variation in wood density and demographic rates.3. Several xylem traits were strongly correlated with each other, but wood density was not correlated with any of them. We also found no significant relationships between wood density and growth or mortality rate. Instead, growth was strongly related to xylem traits associated with hydraulic capacity (conduit diameter and a conductivity index) and to maximum height, whereas mortality rate was strongly correlated only with maximum height. The diameter and frequency of conduits exhibited a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, which restricted variation in wood density and growth rate, but not mortality rate.4. Our results suggest, for woody species in New Zealand, that growth rate is more closely linked to xylem traits determining hydraulic conductance, rather than wood density. We also found no evidence that denser woods conferred higher survival, or that risk of cavitation caused by wide conduits increased mortality.5. In summary, we found little support for the idea that wood density is a good proxy for position along a fast-slow rate-of-living continuum. Instead, the strong, negative relationship between vessel diameter and frequency may constrain the realized diversity of demographic niches of tree species in New Zealand. Trade-offs in function therefore have the potential to shape functional diversity and ecology of forest communities by linking selection on structure and function to population-level dynamics.;;;;;;;;;28;0;27;0;29;0269-8463;;WOS:000274952600002;

This study investigated the effects of the weather conditions and variations in tree factors on diameter growth in a mature forest. In particular, we focused on diameter growth in June, the month of active diameter growth. We recorded the monthly diameter growth of 6 tree species for 7 years and constructed a generalized linear mixed model in which the mean growth was dependant on tree size, weather conditions, and the interaction between tree size and weather.The estimated growth responses to weather factors were different among species. but their interaction to tree size was unclear in all species. Sensitivity analysis of growth rate to weather conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, showed that the sensitivity to weather depended both on tree size and tree species.

Juniperus excelsa is a species with significant growth plasticity, which is capable of surviving and growing under various competition and disturbance regimes. It is also capable of exhibiting the maximum height growth rate at various ages. Moreover, it has the ability to attain significant ring width growth increases at an old age. Regardless of the fact that J. excelsa behaves as a shade tolerant species which can endure shade for many decades, it is not necessarily a shade demanding species since it can germinate and grow under full light.

The aim of this study was to evaluate photosynthetic parameters and growth in seedlings of Bertholletia excelsa and Carapa guianensis in response to pre-acclimation to full sunlight and mild water stress. I used six independent pre-acclimation treatments (0, 90 (11h15-12h45), 180 (10h30-13h30), 360 (09h00-15h00), 540 (07h30-16h30) and 720 min (06h00-18h00)) varying the time of exposure to full sunlight (PFS) during 30 days, followed by whole-day outdoor exposure for 120 days. Before PFS, the plants were kept in a greenhouse at low light levels (0.8 mol m(-2) day(-1)). The PFS of 0 min corresponded to plants constantly kept under greenhouse conditions. From the beginning to the end of the experiment, each PFS treatment was submitted to two water regimes: moderate water stress (MWS, pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(L)) of -500 to -700 kPa) and without water stress (WWS, Psi(L) of-300 kPa, soil kept at field capacity). Plants under MWS received only a fraction of the amount of water applied to the well-watered ones. At the end of the 120-day-period under outdoor conditions, I evaluated light saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E) and plant growth. Both A(max) and g(s) were higher for all plants under the PFS treatment. Stem diameter growth rate and A(max) were higher for C. guianensis subjected to MWS than in well-watered plants. The contrary was true for B. excelsa. The growth of seedlings was enhanced by exposure to full sunlight for 180 minutes in both species. However, plants of B. excelsa were sensitive to moderate water stress. The higher photosynthetic rates and faster growth of C. guianensis under full sun and moderate water stress make this species a promissory candidate to be tested in reforestation programs.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0044-5967;;WOS:000327804500007;

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.;;;;;;;;;41;1;45;0;46;0028-646X;;WOS:000186322000006;

One month before transplanting, the seedlings were assigned to fertilized or nutrient-deprived treatments. Immediately after transplanting, half the seedlings in each nutrient treatment were placed in shadecloth tree shelters. The experimental site was at an altitude of 700 m, which is considered marginal for the establishment of E. nitens plantations in Tasmania because of low mean annual minimum temperatures.Overnight frosts followed by sunny morning conditions in the first 20 weeks after transplanting (early June to early October) caused severe photoinhibition. Predawn maximal photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)) Were depressed in nutrient-deprived seedlings compared with fertilized seedlings, although shading partially alleviated this difference. Neither F-v/F-m nor A(max) recovered to values observed before transplanting until > 20 weeks after transplanting. During this period, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was high in seedlings in all treatments, although NPQ was lower in shaded, fertilized seedlings than in seedlings in the other treatments.Total foliar nitrogen (N) concentration increased up to 42 weeks after transplanting in the nutrient-deprived seedlings in parallel with increasing relative growth rate (RGR). Fractionation of N- and phosphorus (P)-containing compounds indicated that differences in protein N accounted for the treatment differences in total seedling N. Nucleic acid P increased and inorganic P decreased during growth periods, although total seedling P remained constant. Among treated seedlings, height growth was greatest in shaded seedlings: this was probably a result of apical dominance effects because RGR was higher in unshaded seedlings than in shaded seedlings. Thus, the shade treatment alleviated chilling-dependent photoinhibition and maximized growth during winter, but limited growth during warmer periods and therefore overall growth.;;;;;;;;;13;0;10;2;14;0829-318X;;WOS:000181841200001;12566257

H. abyssinica had the highest growth rate but the lowest survival rate in shade. There was a consistent trend for higher specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) at lower growth light regimes in O. europea and P. falcatus. O. europea and P. falcatus had similar allocation patterns whereby between 20-40% of the total biomass uas allocated to stem, 20-30% to roots and 50-60% to leaves. In H. abyssinica up to 80% was allocated to leaves and only a small percentage to stem and to roots.Within species there were significant differences in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area among the plants grown at the lowest light level and in the open.

We found that full structural leaf development is not a necessary prerequisite for maintaining positive CO2 balance in young birch leaves. Maximum rates of A(area) were realized in late June and early July, whereas the highest values of A(mass) occurred in May and steadily declined thereafter. The maintenance respiration rate averaged approximate to 8 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1), whereas growth respiration varied between 0 and 65 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). After reaching its lowest point in mid-June, leaf respiration increased gradually until the end of the growing season. Mass and area-based dark respiration were significantly positively correlated with LMA at stages of leaf maturity, and senescence. Concentrations of P and K decreased during leaf development and stabilized or increased during maturity, and concentrations of immobile elements such as Ca, Mn and B increased throughout the growing season. Identification of interrelations between leaf development, CO2 exchange, TNC and leaf nutrients allowed us to define factors related to ontogenetic variation in leaf-level physiological traits and can be helpful in establishing periods appropriate for sampling birch leaves for diagnostic purposes such as assessment of plant and site productivity or effects of biotic or abiotic factors.;;;;;;;;;31;0;29;0;32;0931-1890;;WOS:000086380200005;

Gas exchange is strongly seasonal in temperate deciduous forests; however, virtually no studies have described measurements made at the leaf scale through the whole growing season. This level of detail is important to understanding processes as substantial differences may occur within the canopy between species and between sun and shade leaves.2. Gas exchange was measured weekly throughout the growing season in leaves of Oak (Quercus robur) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) trees at Wytham Woods, UK. In Q. robur sun, shade and intermediate leaves were sampled on each occasion.3. Acer pseudoplatanus came into leaf before Q. robur and commenced net assimilation (A) earlier. Maximum irradiance saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) in Q. robur were reached approximately 50 days after budburst and were maintained until approximately 20 days before abscission. Acer pseudoplatanus lost its leaves before Q. robur in the autumn and showed no seasonal trend in A(max). The lag between budburst and attainment of maximum photosynthetic rate in Q. robur was substantial and represented a quarter of the potential growing season.4. A(max) of A. pseudoplatanus (3.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) sun leaves was substantially lower than that of Q. robur (10.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) despite A. pseudoplatanus being a fast-growing species. The earlier flushing of A. pseudoplatanus leaves in the spring could not completely compensate for this. It is likely that other variables, such as total leaf area, are responsible for the high growth rate of A. pseudoplatanus, rather than high photosynthetic rates.5. Shade leaves of Q. robur had lower A(max) and mean A than sun leaves; their quantum efficiency was also lower. Consistent with this, sun leaves had a higher nitrogen content per unit area, resulting from a lower specific leaf area (SLA).6. Week to week variations in solar radiation influenced A; this could be described by a non-rectangular hyperbola. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased in conditions of high vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, this did not decrease A as high VPD was associated with high solar radiation and the stimulation of photosynthesis caused by high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) more than compensated for the reduction by VPD.";;;;;;;;;49;3;43;0;52;0269-8463;;WOS:000081534300006;

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.";;;;;;;;;46;3;45;0;50;d_c-58;;WOS:000076300200007;

High production becomes more important as World population increases and the availability of usable agricultural land and irrigation water decrease. Rootstock vigour and irrigation method are among the most important factors that affect the uptake of mineral nutrients and thus tree growth, fruit yield, and fruit quality attributes in apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.). The effects of four rootstocks and two irrigation systems on leaf size and mineral nutrition, and on the interaction between leaf nutrient concentrations, growth, and fruit quality attributes were studied over 4 years in 'Pacific Gala' apple. Evapotranspiration (ETc)-based irrigation scheduling, adjusted for the percentage of ground shading, was used for both the sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Leaf calcium (Ca) concentrations decreased, but leaf potassium (K) concentrations increased with increasing rootstock vigour, resulting in the highest leaf Ca, but the lowest leaf K concentrations in trees on `Budagovsky 9' (B.9) dwarfing rootstock. On average, trees supplied by drip irrigation had larger fruit and higher leaf magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn), but lower leaf Ca, K, zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentrations than those irrigated using the sprinkler system. A significantly lower volume of water was applied to trees using drip irrigation than by sprinkler irrigation. Highly-negative correlations were found between leaf K concentrations and leaf dry weight percentages (DW%), between starch degradation pattern (SDP) and fruit firmness, between leaf K and leaf Mg concentrations, and between leaf K and leaf Mn concentrations. Highly-positive correlations existed between leaf N and leaf Fe concentrations, between fruit yields and leaf N concentrations, and among the concentrations of most leaf micro-nutrients.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1462-0316;;WOS:000328433800002;

Various aspen progenies (Populus tremula and P tremuloides) with different growth performance are used in short-rotation forestry. Hence, a better understanding of the link between root trait syndromes and the adaptation of a deme to a particular environment is essential in order to improve the match between planted varieties and their growth conditions. We examined the between-deme (genetic) and within-deme (mostly environmental) variation in important fine root traits [mean root diameter, specific root area (SRA) and specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RID), root tip abundance, root N concentration] and their co-variation with leaf traits [specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, leaf N concentration] in eight genetically distinct P tremula and P tremuloides demes. Five of the six root traits varied significantly between the demes with largest genotypic variation in root tip abundance and lowest in mean root diameter and RID (no significant difference). Within-deme variation in root morphology was as large as between-deme variation suggesting a relatively low genetic control. Significant relationships existed neither between SLA and SRA nor between leaf N and root N concentration in a plant. Contrary to expectation, high aboveground relative growth rates (RGR) were associated with large, and not small, fine root diameters with low SRA and SRL. Compared to leaf traits, the influence of root traits on RGR was generally low. We conclude that aspen exhibits large intraspecific variation in leaf and also in root morphological traits which is only partly explained by genetic distances. A root order-related analysis might give deeper insights into intraspecific root trait variation.;;;;;;;;;3;0;2;0;3;1664-462X;;WOS:000331441300001;24155751

Four simulated rainfall regimes were applied: 600 mm year(-1) (severe water deficit), 800 mm year(-1) (mild water deficit), 1,000 mm year(-1) (mild wet), and 1,200 mm year(-1) (well-watered) used as control. Provenances were compared in terms of water relations (midday leaf water potential, I (md) and relative water content, RWC), growth (root, shoot and leaf length, neck diameter), growth rate (shoot- and neck growth rate, SGR and NGR), biomass production (root, shoot and leaf dry weight), and biomass allocation (root:shoot ratio, RSR). Multivariate analyses revealed that water relations differed significantly under all simulated rainfall treatments by means of several variables throughout time. Effects of species x treatment, and provenance nested within species x treatment interactions significantly were important. SGR and RSR also were important to explain differences in I (md) and RWC between treatments and provenances. Broadly C. balansae and C. saltensis provenances seem to display a better performance than C. fissilis provenances under severe water deficit only. However, despite differences between provenances, it was not possible to clearly separate them according to their origin, based on water relations and growth performance. Even though the results of this study performed on pot-grown seedlings are based on relatively few observations and require additional confirmation, they allow an opportunity for speculation on the factors that are related to intraspecific variations that are likely to occur during the growth of seedlings from different geographical sites in field condition.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0167-4366;;WOS:000324337300004;

Monstera are secondary hemiepiphytes that inhabit the understory of tropical rainforests, where photosynthesis from sunflecks often makes up a large proportion of daily carbon assimilation. Here I present a simple model of leaf-level photosynthesis and whole-plant canopy dynamics in a stochastic light environment. The model demonstrates that leaf fenestration can reduce the variance in plant growth and thereby increase geometric mean fitness. This growth-variance hypothesis also suggests explanations for conspicuous ontogenetic changes in leaf morphology (heteroblasty) in Monstera, as well as the absence of leaf fenestration in co-occurring juvenile tree species. The model provides a testable hypothesis of the adaptive significance of a unique leaf shape and illustrates how variance in growth rate could be an important factor shaping plant morphology and physiology.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0003-0147;;WOS:000314091200014;23348781

To evaluate genetic differentiation between geographical origins we compared vigor and leaf morphology of trees from 17 West African and 13 East African provenances of baobab. Seedlings were grown and evaluated in a common garden test at Bamako, Mali. Germination was assessed and growth measured 3 and 12 months after germination. Leaf morphology (leaf length, leaflet number, petiole length and diameter and leaflet border) were assessed after 12 months. Significant differences between the provenances were observed for both growth rate and leaf morphology. West African provenances in general grew faster than East African provenances, but leaf characters did not reveal a particular geographic structure, and the correlations between geographic distances and multivariate Mahalanobis distances were not significant. The correlations between leaf morphological traits and climatic data were in general low at the provenance level. However, the number of leaflets was significantly higher for provenances from drier areas. Two years increment at a field site also varied significantly between the provenances, where West African provenances confirmed their tendency to higher growth rate. Still, trees are young and results regarding both growth data and leaf characteristics should be confirmed when the trees are closer to maturity.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0167-4366;;WOS:000306585800016;

The aim of this work was to analyze changes in the foliar internal anatomy (tissue proportions and cell dimensions) and external morphology (leaf length, width and area) of Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser seedlings growing in a greenhouse under controlled irradiance (three levels) and soil moisture (two levels) during one growing season (measured three times), and to relate them to physiological traits. Three irradiance levels (4, 26 and 64% of the natural incident light) and two soil moisture levels (40 and 80% soil capacity) were evaluated during November, January and March. Internal foliar anatomy of seedlings was analyzed using digital photographs of histological cuttings, while leaf gross morphology was measured using digital calipers and image analysis software. Most internal anatomical variables presented significant differences under different irradiance levels during the growing season, but differences were not detected between soil moisture levels. Palisade parenchyma was the tissue most sensitive to irradiance levels, and high irradiance levels (64% natural incident light) produced greater values in most of the internal anatomical variables than lower irradiance levels (4-24% natural incident light). Complementarily, larger leaves were observed in medium and low irradiance levels, as well as under low soil moisture levels (40% soil capacity). The relationship of main results with some eco-physiological traits was discussed. Foliar internal anatomical and external morphological plasticity allows quick acclimation of seedlings to environmental changes (e.g., during harvesting). These results can be used to propose new forest practices that consider soil moisture and light availability changes to maintain high physiological performance of seedlings.";;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0829-318X;;WOS:000304538700006;22499597

Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size.2. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts.3. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts.4. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density.5. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components.;;;;;;;;;17;3;19;1;21;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200015;

Secondary forest types were: Vismia (on land formerly clear-cut, used for pasture and intensively burned) and Cecropia (no pasture usage or intensive fires after clear-cut).Results: A principal components analysis indicated that most of the primary forest species exhibited a similar habit and were characterized by short shoots and small, round leaves with low specific leaf area, whereas secondary forest species had a broad range of trait values. At the plot level, primary and secondary forest communities were separated mainly by plant length and leaf size. Plant size varied more within secondary than within primary forest plots.

Tree allometry often varies among coexisting species of different maximum height (H(max)) in forests. Although shoot growth patterns directly influence overall tree architecture, the structures of current-year shoots at the tops of crowns have not been directly related to differences in tree allometry across species.2. I investigated height-dependent changes in structure and biomass allocation patterns in current-year shoots of four coexisting tree species differing in H(max) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The relative importance of total biomass, biomass allocation, shoot allometry, and shoot angle to vertical growth was quantified and compared with tree allometry.3. Height-dependent changes in total biomass of current-year shoots varied across species. In contrast, stem length per unit mass, shoot angle, and total leaf area per unit stem cross-sectional area decreased, and leaf mass per unit area increased with height in all species. Vertical growth rate consequently declined with increasing height in all species. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the primary determinant of declining vertical growth rate was change in stem length per unit mass; shoot angle was a secondary determinant. In contrast, increases in total shoot mass with height modulated declining vertical growth rates.4. Vertical growth rate was greater in two canopy species than in two sub-canopy species at given heights at the shoot level, and this pattern coincided with allometry between tree height and trunk diameter. In contrast, vertical growth rate was greater in sub-canopy species than in canopy species near their maximum heights. These patterns suggest that allometric differences between species may be useful for evaluating crown-development patterns, but not for estimating H(max) of species.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0269-8463;;WOS:000292330000006;

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.7.

Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000282978100020;

Data were collected from one final harvest of 13 individuals of three different subspecies growing on the hosts Betula pendula, Abies alba and Pin us sylvestris. Compared to Viscum album ssp. album growing on deciduous hosts, the two subspecies abietis and austriacum (syn. laxum) on evergreen hosts showed longer average leaf life spans, but leaves continuously increased in area over time up to an age of at least 4 years irrespective of host. Relative growth rates in plant dry matter (RGR; 0.53-0.61 g g(-1) a(-1)) were in the same range as of deciduous shrubs in central Europe but clearly higher than in mature forest trees. However, this growth is hidden within the spherical crowns of mistletoes, as annual increase in crown volume is extraordinarily low, resulting in very high leaf area densities (LAD; 7.7-17.6 m(2) m(-3)), not found in any other woody species. Besides differences in leaf size and phenology, the three subspecies exhibit similar patterns of partitioning. As in other mistletoe species, significant parts of dry matter are regularly allocated into fruit production (10-15%). Regarding the generally lower net photosynthesis rates in mistletoes as compared to their hosts, it is questioned, whether photoautotrophic carbon gain of the leaves is sufficient to maintain the observed high relative growth rates.

The structural (e.g., clump density, clump area, ramet density per clump) and morphological (e.g., leaf size, LMA, diameter, height, and biomass) responses of F. nitida to elevation are not linear but form a one-humped, convex curve with a turning point at 2850 m a.s.l., as already shown in a previous study with Q. aquifolioides carried out within the same elevational gradient on the same slope. These findings indicated that the fast-growing plants without secondary growth (F. nitida) respond to elevation similar with the slow-growing plants with secondary growth (Q. aquifolioides).

Sapling architecture may be an important determinant of performance traits, such as light interception and height growth, but few studies have examined the direct relationship between sapling architecture and growth properties. To study this relationship and the potential for strategic diversification, we analysed the growth properties in saplings of 16 Bornean tree species that differ in architecture.2. Annual net production significantly differed amongst species and was positively correlated with total above-ground dry mass, total leaf area and crown area. In contrast, the net assimilation rate was weakly but negatively correlated with these architectural traits. The net assimilation rate was virtually independent of leaf size and specific leaf area. Relationships between sapling architecture and relative growth rate in mass were weak.3. The relative growth rate in height did not significantly differ amongst species, although their total dry mass, a proxy for extension cost, varied fourfold across species for a given sapling height. This is because the proportional increase in net production with total dry mass, which is based on a larger total leaf area and larger crown area, cancelled out the higher extension cost. All architectural traits, including leaf size and specific leaf area, failed to predict height growth rate.4. Synthesis. Relative growth rates in both mass and height were relatively independent of sapling architecture. Of the architectural traits, leaf size, specific leaf area and stem diameter were poor predictors of growth properties, even though they were considered functionally important. These results clearly reject the classic hypothesis that architectural variation leads to a trade-off between height growth and light interception, at least for the species that are under shaded conditions. However, functional variation ranging from species with high net production and low net assimilation rates (in saplings of equal height) to species with the opposite traits, which was accompanied by architectural variation in total dry mass and related size factors, may be important for the coexistence of these tree species. The possibility that small total dry mass may be advantageous in height growth under well-lit conditions should be examined in future studies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0022-0477;;WOS:000268928200017;

Here, new phenotypes and touch-regulated gene homologues have been identified that can be used to advance the understanding of thigmomorphogenesis, a multigenic response involving mechanoreception and morphological change.Morphological alterations were quantified, and microscopy of tissue was conducted. Assays for hypocotyl anthocyanins, lignin and chlorophyll were performed, and predicted genes from C. papaya were compared with Arabidopsis touch-inducible (TCH) and Mechanosensitive channel of Small conductance-like genes (MscS-like or MSL). In addition, the expression of two papaya TCH1 homologues was characterized.On the abaxial side of petioles, treated plants were found to have novel, hypertrophic outgrowths associated with periderm and suberin. Touched plants also had higher lignin, dramatically less hypocotyl anthocyanins and chlorophyll, increased hypocotyl diameter, and decreased leaf width, stem length and root fresh weight. Papaya was found to have fewer MSL genes than Arabidopsis, and four touch-regulated genes in Arabidopsis had no counterparts in papaya. Water-spray treatment was found to enhance the expression of two papaya TCH1 homologues whereas induction following touch was only slightly correlated.The novel petiole outgrowths caused by non-wounding, mechanical perturbation may be the result of hardening mechanisms, including added lignin, providing resistance against petiole movement. Inhibition of anthocyanin accumulation following touch, a new phenotypic association, may be caused by diversion of p-coumaroyl CoA away from chalcone synthase for lignin synthesis. The absence of MSL and touch-gene homologues indicates that papaya may have a smaller set of touch-regulated genes. The genes and novel touch-regulated phenotypes identified here will contribute to a more comprehensive view of thigmomorphogenesis in plants.;;;;;;;;;8;1;8;0;9;0305-7364;;WOS:000264387600004;19182220

An important observation deriving from these investigations is the confirmation that population behaviour varies both in time and space. A tool recently developed to evaluate the potential for variation in vital rates, and therefore in Population growth rate, is variance-standardized perturbation analysis (VSPA). In this paper we report the results of a 2-y demographic analysis of a population of the tropical tree Manilkara zapota in a subtropical rain forest in the Mexican state of Veracruz, in which variance-standardized perturbation analysis was applied and compared with the results of the traditional elasticity analyses. To build population projection matrices. we tagged and followed a sample of 91 juvenile and adult individuals, and 635 seedlings. We subdivided the sample in nine size classes (defined by tree height and dbh; as well as leaf size, in the case of seedlings) and estimated transition probabilities and fecundity for each class. The demography of M. zapota varied greatly from the first to the second year of study (in 1998-1999. lambda = 0.987, while in 1999-2000, lambda = 1.038) due to negligible seed production during the first year and a massive reproductive event during the second. The largest elasticity values for both years corresponded to persistence of large juveniles and adults. Although the fecundity entries showed very low elasticity values, the variance-standardized perturbation analysis revealed the importance of these matrix entries; transition to larger categories and retrogression to smaller ones of saplings and juveniles were also important demographic processes contributing to variation lambda according to the VSPA. Thus, although the results of elasticity analysis and VSPA were similar for the 1998-1999 matrix, they differed substantially for the 1999-2000 matrix. In the latter, the VSPA enhanced the importance of demographic processes that are intuitively relevant for the population studied. This points toward the necessity of further exploring the use of VSPA. since it offers several advantages over the traditional elasticity analysis: it, concentrates on the impact on lambda of vital rates that actually vary, and the interpretation of the results is more realistic and straight forward.";;;;;;;;;2;0;2;1;2;0266-4674;;WOS:000264212400003;

Do tree species differ in their susceptibility to lianas? 2. What host tree traits (branch-free bole height, growth rate, bark type, leaf length and adult stature) are correlated with the susceptibility of tree species to lianas infesting the trunk and the crown? 3. To what extent do spatial variables (proximity to liana-infested trees and the light environment of the tree crown) affect the likelihood of liana infestation? 4. Are spatial variables or tree traits relatively more important in influencing the susceptibility of trees to lianas? We address all questions separately for trunk and crown infestation.Location: Tambopata Nature Reserve, Peru.Methods: We collected information on liana infestation, tree morphological traits, growth, light-environment and position for 3675 trees in seven 1-ha permanent sample plots. We separated trunk from crown infestation and used correlation and logistic regression analyses for tree species and individual tree-level analyses, respectively.Results: Half of all trees were colonised by at least one liana. Of 41 relatively common dicot tree species, at least five have significantly greater and three significantly lower crown infestation rates than expected by chance. Trunk and crown infestation are influenced by different host traits - trunk infestation was only affected by bark type, while crown infestation is reduced when trees are fast-growing, tall, have low-density wood, long branch-free boles and long leaves. The likelihood of both trunk and crown infestation increases for trees growing in close proximity to another liana-infested tree, but is invariant with the light environment of tree crowns.Conclusion: Crown and trunk infestation have not been properly distinguished before; it is important to do so as the factors determining the different modes of infestation differ fundamentally. The association between crown infestation and tree traits suggests that increases in liana dominance in Amazonian forests could cause changes in forest composition, including favouring faster growing tree species with low density wood, potentially reducing the carbon stored by mature forests.";;;;;;;;;17;0;15;2;18;1100-9233;;WOS:000264001900002;

The hypotheses were tested that the degree of branching (L(TB)) correlates with leaf traits and that height growth rate is negatively correlated with the degree of branching and leaf life span (LLS) by examining saplings of live canopy and subcanopy species, two shrub species and one invasive subshrub species (Clidemia hirta) in a tropical rain forest, West Java, Indonesia. Of the eight species, the most and least branched species were Castanopsis acuminatissima and Macaranga semiglobosa, respectively. Leaf traits examined were leaf size, LLS, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen concentration per mass (N(mass)) and per area. LLS tended to be positively correlated with LMA, and negatively correlated with N(mass). Leaf size was negatively correlated with LTB, but the other leaf traits were not correlated with L(TB). The height growth of the eight species was low, irrespective of L(TB) and LLS, for understorey individuals. The height growth of gap individuals was negatively correlated with LLS for the eight species, and also negatively with LTB for the seven species other than one subshrub species. Thus, the degree of branching was correlated with leaf size only among the five leaf traits, and both leaf life span and the degree of branching affected the height growth of gap individuals, except for the subshrub species.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0266-4674;;WOS:000258043300008;

We predicted that Q. pyrenaica would behave more as a stress-tolerant species, with lower specific leaf area (SLA), allocation to leaf mass, and growth rate and less responsiveness to light in these metrics, than Q. petraea, presumed to be more competitive when resources, especially light and water, are abundant. Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL. They also displayed a higher proportion of biomass in stems (SMF), and a lower root to shoot ratio (R/S) in HL than those of Q. pyrenaica, which sprouted profusely, and had higher rates of photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(wv)), but lower whole-plant net assimilation rate (NAR). On exposure to a sudden increase in light, SH-HL seedlings of both species showed a short period of photoinhibition, but fully acclimated photosynthetic features within 46 days after transference; height, main stem diameter, RGR and NAR all increased at the end of the experiment compared to SH seedlings, with these increases more pronounced in Q. petraea. Observed differences in traits and responses to light confirmed a contrasting ecology at the seedling stage in Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica in consonance with differences in their overall distribution. We discuss how the characteristics of Q. petraea may limit the availability of suitable regeneration niches to microsites of high-resource availability in marginal populations of Mediterranean climate, with potential negative consequences for its recruitment under predicted climatic changes.";;;;;;;;;9;0;7;0;9;1385-0237;;WOS:000253995800009;

Aiming to investigate leaf development and its importance for individual survival, fifteen contiguous plots (1 x 1 m) were set down in Jambreiro Forest (19 degrees 58'-59' S and 43 degrees 52'-55'W, 800-1100 m altitude), in the municipality of Nova Lima.

Plant size was measured through leaf blade length, petiole length, stem length, and number of leaves. Significant changes were detected only after two years, thus indicating that plant growth is slow. The proportion of surviving leaves after two years was 60%. Total blade expansion took over 14 months, a slow growth rate when compared to leaves of other tropical forest canopy and understory species. Long leaf lifespans are to be found in plants exhibiting slow growth, and we observed that some leaves lived longer than three years. Petiole growth can help to better position the leaf in the search for light, thus contributing to the growth and survival of the plant. The relationships among size measures were significant, reinforcing the great contribution of leaf size for plant size. The age of the largest individual was estimated as 36 years based on the median annual leaf production rate.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1519-6984;;WOS:000256436300001;18470372

We controlled for this effect by measuring all of the components of annual growth associated with leaf production at the individual terminal shoot level. Hence, number of leaves produced was expressed as 'leafing intensity', i.e. the number of leaves produced by newly emerged (current year's) shoots, divided by the total volume of these shoots.Ninety per cent (r(2) = 0.90) of the variation in mean individual leaf mass across species, spanning two orders of magnitude, could be accounted for by proportional variation in mean leafing intensity, i.e. representing an isometric trade-off, with a slope for log-transformed data that did not deviate significantly from -1.0.We suggest that this isometric relationship may represent a generalized trade-off strategy for leaf deployment at the shoot level within temperate deciduous woody species. Following traditional interpretations, adaptation here may involve a fitness benefit associated with a particular leaf size. The present results also suggest an alternative, i.e. selection may instead favour high leafing intensity, with small leaf mass resulting not as a direct adaptation, but simply as a trade-off.According to this 'leafing intensity premium' hypothesis, the fitness benefits of higher leafing intensity are associated primarily with the fitness benefits of a larger pool of lateral meristems, because each leaf is usually associated with an axillary bud. This may in turn provide greater facility for wide phenotypic plasticity in the allocation of these meristems to vegetative vs. reproductive functions. This represents a plausible hypothesis, we suggest, in accounting for why most woody deciduous angiosperms, even some of the largest/tallest ones, have relatively small leaves.;;;;;;;;;33;9;37;0;44;0022-0477;;WOS:000244114400017;

We consider the hypothesis that the habit evolved as a structural photoprotection mechanism that maximises potential carbon fixation by minimising photoinhibition. Plants were grown in pots in full sun, or behind vertical screens transmitting c. 25, 52, or 73% sunlight. When shaded, all species shifted partitioning of biomass from stem thickening to leaf area expansion and occupied a larger crown volume for a given shoot biomass. Leaf numbers per stem length of divaricates and non-divaricates were greater in the lower and upper canopies, respectively, consistent with the view that in divaricates outer branches protect inner leaves. However, leaf numbers per stem length showed no response to variation in high light receipt. Divaricates showed some traits typical of plants adapted to sunny habitats: smaller effective leaf size, lesser fractional partitioning of biomass to leaves, and greater foliage densities. Other traits of divaricates were typical of plants adapted to shaded habitats: lesser stem diameters, stem biomass per unit stem length, leader dominance, leaf area index, and heights relative to crown diameters; and more horizontal twig orientations. Compensation for high costs of support of photosynthetic area in divaricates (leaf area per unit shoot biomass c. 1.3 m(2)kg(-1)) compared with non-divaricates (c. 5.5 m(2) kg(-1)) would require a larger enhancement of net canopy photosynthesis than is likely to arise from avoidance of photoinhibition.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0028-825X;;WOS:000239326600006;

Sudden exposure to full sunlight resulted in an immediate and substantial reduction in dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem I (F(v)/F(m)), followed by a gradual recovery in all species.

Rootstocks selected from seven Actinidia species (A. chrysantha Merri.,A. deliciosa (A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A.R. Ferguson, A. eriantha Benth., A. hemsleyana Dunn, A. kolomikta (Maxim. et Rupr.) Maxim., A. macrosperma C.F. Liang and A. polygama (Sieb. et Zucc.) Maxim.) were grafted with the scion Actinidia chinensis Planch. var. chinensis 'Hort16A' (yellow kiwifruit). Based on an earlier architectural analysis of A. chinensis, axillary shoot types produced by the scion were classified as short, medium or long. Short and medium shoots produced a restricted number of preformed leaves before the shoot apex ceased growth and aborted, resulting in a 'terminated' shoot. The apex of long shoots continued growth and produced more nodes throughout the growing seasons. Mid-season LAI of the scion was related to the proportion of shoots that ceased growth early in the season. Scions on low-vi-or rootstocks had 50% or less leaf area than scions on the most vigorous rootstocks and had a higher proportion of short and medium shoots. On low-vigor rootstocks, a higher proportion of short shoots was retained during pruning to form the parent structure of the following year. Short parent shoots produced a higher proportion of short daughter shoots than long parent shoots, thus reinforcing the effect of the low-vigor rootstocks. However, overall effects of rootstock on shoot development were consistent regardless of parent shoot type and nodal position within the parent shoot. Slower-growing shoots were more likely to terminate and scions on low-vigor rootstocks produced a higher proportion of slow-growing shoots. Shoot termination also occurred earlier on low-vigor rootstocks. The slower growth of terminating shoots was detectable from about 20 days after bud burst. Removal of a proportion of shoots at the end of bud burst increased the growth rate and decreased the frequency of termination of the remaining shoots on all rootstocks, indicating that the fate of a shoot was linked to competitive interactions among shoots during initial growth immediately after bud burst. Rootstock influenced the process of shoot termination independently of its effect on final leaf size. Scions on low-vigor rootstocks had a higher proportion of short shoots and short shoots on all rootstocks had smaller final leaf sizes at equivalent nodes than medium or long shoots. Only later in the development of long shoots was final leaf size directly related to rootstock, with smaller leaves on low-vigor rootstocks. Thus, the most important effect of these Actinidia rootstocks on scion development occurred during the initial period of shoot growth immediately after bud burst.;;;;;;;;;9;0;7;0;9;0829-318X;;WOS:000236438900011;16414929

Phenology of the host-plant affects traits of its herbivores, including size, growth rate, development time, and gregariousness. Traits of herbivores in turn determine what traits ants must have to protect their host. Diversity in plant phenological traits could thus help explain the great ecological diversity of coevolved ant-plant mutualisms. We explored the postulated causal chain linking phenology of the plant, herbivore adaptations to phenology, and ant adaptations for protection, by comparing two myrmecophytes presenting strong contrasts in phenology. In Leonardoxa africana, a slow-growing understory tree, growth at each twig terminal is intermittent, the rapid flushing of a single leaf-bearing internode being followed by a pause of several months. In contrast, axes of Barteria nigritana, a tree of open areas, grow continuously. Analysis of the phenology (kinetics of expansion) and chemistry of leaf development (contents of chlorophylls, lignin, and nitrogen during leaf growth) showed that these two species exhibit strongly contrasting strategies. Leonardoxa exhibited a delayed greening strategy, with rapid expansion of leaves during a short period, followed by synthesis of chlorophylls and lignins only after final leaf size has been reached. In contrast, leaves of Barteria expanded more slowly, with chlorophylls and lignin gradually synthesised throughout development. Differences in the phenology of leaf development are reflected in differences in the duration of larval development, and thereby in size, of the principal lepidopteran herbivores observed on these two plants. This difference may in turn have led to different requirements for effective defence by ants. The strategy of phenological defence may thus affect the evolution of biotic defence.;;;;;;;;;5;0;4;0;5;0937-7409;;WOS:000243259900007;

Path analysis was conducted to explore the effects of light availability, basal height and size of individual branches on branch structure and growth.Branch angle was affected by basal height, whereas branch mass was influenced primarily by light availability. This result suggests that branch structure is strongly constrained by basal height, and that trees mediate such constraints under different light environments.Previous-year leaf area and light availability showed positive effects on current-year stem mass. In contrast, branch basal height and mass negatively affected current-year stem mass. Moreover, the length of stems of a given diameter decreased with increasing branch height. Therefore the cost of biomass investment for a unit growth in length is greater for branches of larger size and at upper positions.Vertical growth rate in length decreased with increasing height.

Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1 - 1.5m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis ( PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size.Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size.Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.;;;;;;;;;12;0;12;0;12;0305-7364;;WOS:000230724400015;15944175

Growing leaves of Populus deltoides, in stands maintained under ambient and elevated CO2 for up to 4 years, showed a high degree of heterogeneity and pronounced diel variations of their relative growth rate (RGR) with maxima at dusk. At the beginning of the season, leaf growth did not differ between treatments. At the end of the season, final individual leaf area and total leaf biomass of the canopy was increased in elevated CO2. Increased final leaf area at elevated CO2 was achieved via a prolonged phase of leaf expansion activity and not via larger leaf size upon emergence. The fraction of leaves growing at 30-40% day(-1) was increased by a factor of two in the elevated CO2 treatment. A transient minimum of leaf expansion developed during the late afternoon in leaves grown under elevated CO2 as the growing season progressed. During this minimum, leaves grown under elevated CO2 decreased their RGR to 50% of the ambient value. The transient growth minimum in the afternoon was correlated with a transient depletion of glucose (less than 50%) in the growing leaf in elevated CO2, suggesting diversion of glucose to starch or other carbohydrates, making this substrate temporarily unavailable for growth. Increased leaf growth was observed at the end of the night in elevated CO2. Net CO2 exchange and starch concentration of growing leaves was higher in elevated CO2. The extent to which the transient reduction in diel leaf growth might dampen the overall growth response of these trees to elevated CO2 is discussed.;;;;;;;;;21;1;22;1;26;1354-1013;;WOS:000230726600002;

Hayne and A. xanthophloea Benth. were watered either every other day (well watered) or every 7 days (water- stressed) for 1 year in a greenhouse. Total plant dry mass (T-dm), carbon allocation and water relations were measured monthly. Differences in leaf area (LA) accounted for differences in Tdm between the species, and between well-watered and water-stressed plants. Reduction in LA as a result of water stress was attributed to reduced leaf initiation, leaf growth rate and leaf size. When subjected to prolonged water stress, Acacia xanthophloea wilted more rapidly than A. tortilis and, unlike A. tortilis, lost both leaves and branches. These differences between species were attributed to differences in the allocation of carbon between leaves and roots and in the ability to adjust osmotically. Rapid recovery in A. xanthophloea following the prolonged water-stress treatment was attributed to high cell wall elasticity. Previous exposure to water stress contributed to water-stress resistance and improved recovery after stress.;;;;;;;;;19;3;18;1;23;0829-318X;;WOS:000227507200011;15631984

There is, however, an increasing demand for crop models that simulate the genetic and resource-dependent variability of plant geometry and architecture, because man is increasingly able to transform plant production systems through combined genetic and environmental engineering.Model GREENLAB is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual-scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non-limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other 'hidden' plant parameters are calibrated using the non-linear, least-square method.Key Results and Conclusions The model reproduced accurately the dynamics of plant growth, architecture and geometry of various annual and woody plants, enabling 3D visualization. It was also able to simulate the variability of leaf size on the plant and compensatory growth following pruning, as a result of internal competition for resources. The potential of the model's underlying concepts to predict the plant's phenotypic plasticity is discussed.

LA;J;King, DA;;;;;;;;Stem orientation is related to growth rate, leaf dimensions, and the deciduous habit in temperate forest saplings;;;;;;;;CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE;;;;79;11;;;1282;1291;;;;;nov-01;2001;The orientation of the central stem is a key component of tree architecture. Stem orientation was related to extension rate in saplings growing in light conditions ranging from forest understories to large openings in 11 deciduous angiosperms, 1 evergreen angiosperm, and 2 evergreen conifers in the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States. Most of the deciduous species showed pronounced differences between arced, dorsiventrally symmetric forms in slow-growing, shaded saplings and erect, radially symmetric forms in fast growing, sunlit saplings. In contrast, the evergreen species showed little or no shift in stem orientation in relation to growth rate and tended to be more erect in shade than the deciduous species. Evergreen saplings studied at other sites were also more erect in shade than the deciduous species studied here. Within the deciduous species, the degree of arcing in shade declined with increasing leaf size and petiole length. These results, involving two congeneric pairs, suggest that stem orientation is related more to leaf dimensions and leaf habit than to taxonomic classification per se. The positioning of a single cohort of nonoverlapping leaves in shaded deciduous saplings may increase the efficiency of light interception in arced forms, as compared with evergreen saplings, where new leaves must be positioned in relation to older leaf cohorts.;;;;;;;;;9;0;9;0;9;ao_t-26;;WOS:000172265000005;

Mean leaf CC differed between ecosystems, with the highest and lowest CC in the tundra and rain forest, respectively. Leaf CC was positively correlated with lipid concentration.

Leaf CC did not show differences between different leaf life-spans or ecosystems when leaf size (log) or SLA were included as covariates.The small differences in leaf CC among leaf life-span types and ecosystems (6% and 23%, respectively) suggest that SLA is more important in determining differences in the carbon balance between species than leaf CC.

We examined developmental stability in mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii along a strong pollution gradient in the Kola Peninsula, north-western Russia, over a period of 8 years (1993-2000). In particular, we investigated whether climatic factors or aerial pollution could increase developmental instability, which was assessed through leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA).2. Contrary to our expectations, leaf FA was not correlated with either distance from the pollution source, or with the levels of nickel and sulphur dioxide pollution in the study plots, or with shoot length or leaf size. There was, however, variation in FA between years: highest values of developmental instability were recorded during the coldest summers.3. There was also considerable among-tree variation in FA within plots, suggesting that birch genets either responded differently to environmental stress or demonstrated a different degree of genetic stress. The significant interaction between study year and birch genet suggests that the detected variation was a consequence of different sensitivity of the trees to climatic fluctuations rather than of different sensitivity to pollution.4. Growth rate of birch correlated positively with developmental stability, i.e. faster leaf growth was associated with lower FA both at the scale of individual trees (presumably genetic differences) and at the scale of study years (environmental differences).5. The lack of detectable response to aerial pollution by mountain birch in this study may be an outcome of selection for pollution-resistant genotypes, which may have occurred due to an exceptionally high emission pressure during the past decades. On the other hand, resistance to temperature variations may not have evolved because warm and cold periods appear to occur somewhat regularly in the Kola Peninsula, and therefore variation in temperature optima between genotypes is favoured by natural selection.6. Our results demonstrate that FA may serve as a useful measure of climatic stress in plants.;;;;;;;;;40;0;36;1;41;0021-8901;;WOS:000169479900014;

Blake: response of seedlings to water and pH levels;;;;;;;;OECOLOGIA;;;;127;4;;;487;494;;10.1007/s004420000621;;;MAY 2001;2001;Melaleuca quinquenervia is a wetland tree species indigenous to eastern Australia. It was separately introduced to east and west Florida as an ornamental, but has since become invasive, dominating several habitat types. We tested the predictions that (1) Australian populations would exhibit more genetic variation than Florida populations, due to founder effect, and (2) high phenotypic plasticity would be found in all populations, due to the wide range of habitats occupied. We compared the phenotypic plasticity and familial variation among three Australian populations, two east Florida, and two west Florida populations in a greenhouse experiment. We grew seedlings collected from different maternal trees in each population under two water levels and three pH levels, reflecting the natural range of water levels and soil pH in Florida and Australian Melaleuca stands. We measured leaf size and shape, growth rate and above-ground biomass of seedlings and determined the components of phenotypic variance (familial, environmental. and their interaction) using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. All traits showed significant among-population and among-family variation, as well as significant phenotypic plasticity, in response to both water level and pH level changes. Sensitivity to pH was particularly high, presumably because plants were grown under pHs ranging from 4.7 to 7.4, and because pH can influence nutrient availability. Familial variation contains genetic variation, but it may also be confounded with maternal environmental effects. Comparing Australian to Floridian Melaleuca, amounts of familial variation and phenotypic plasticity varied by trait. Overall, Australian Melaleuca had more among-population variation than Floridian Melaleuca, presumably reflecting the wider latitudinal range and longer time for evolutionary change in Australia, but had similar amounts of among-family variation, within any one population. If maternal effects are strong, among-population differences may merely reflect greater environmental differences among Australian sites than Florida sites. Australian Melaleuca had less phenotypic plasticity, possibly due to founder effects in Florida or to subsequent adaptive evolution of phenotypic plasticity in Floridian populations. Floridian Melaleuca shows little loss of familial variation, compared to indigenous Australian populations, and that, in combination with its high phenotypic plasticity, should allow it to continue to colonize new areas successfully.;;;;;;;;;51;1;50;1;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000169204100004;

We carried out field experiments to test the resource availability hypothesis as well as the crown architecture hypothesis, which attributes changes in the time of budburst in the year following herbivory to changes in the proportion of different bud types. We examined predictions from these hypotheses using a defoliator, Choristoneura fumiferana; a defoliator/stem feeder, Zeiraphera canadensis; and a stem galler, Adelges abietis; on white spruce, Picea glauca. The time of budburst and final lear size of unexploited midcrown shoots of white spruce were compared to those of adjacent exploited shoots. We also evaluated budburst in a manipulated field study, in which tree growth was reduced through root pruning and increased through fertilization.Partial defoliation by C. fumiferana and Z. canadensis did not affect budburst, but did result in smaller leaves. Almost complete defoliation of shoots by C. fumiferana and galling by A. abietis resulted in delayed budburst. Reductions in leaf size were directly related to the amount of herbivory (i.e., low or high) by C. fumiferana and Z. canadensis. Budburst of trees whose growth rate had been decreased by root pruning or increased by fertilizing occurred later and sooner, respectively, than budburst on unmanipulated trees. The time of budburst was inversely correlated with foliar nitrogen and water content and the length of unexploited shoots. These results supported the resource availability hypothesis. The influence of resource availability on time of budburst was observed at the shoot, branch, and whole-tree levels, When >50% of stems were destroyed by Z. canadensis, budburst occurred earlier or at the same time in the following spring. This was due to the production of basal buds, which burst before all other buds on a shoot. The production of early-bursting basal buds more than compensated, or just compensated, for a small delay in budburst of terminal, distal-lateral. and medial-lateral buds. Thus, changes in the time of budburst in the year following herbivory were due to changes in crown architecture as well as to changes in resource availability. We predict that increased intra-tree heterogeneity in the time of budburst should make P. glauca more, rather than less, susceptible to two of the herbivores studied because of the presence of a highly nutritious food source, newly burst buds, for a longer period of time. We suggest that the influence of previous herbivory on the time of budburst in the next growing season is a commonly overlooked factor that may have a large influence on herbivore abundance and distribution.";;;;;;;;;26;0;25;0;26;d_c-58;;WOS:000085187900021;

A comparison was made between crown development in closed understorey forest sites (low light) and in canopy gaps (high light); development was expressed by plant traits at multiple levels of organisation.Dicorynia and Vouacapoua responded to gap creation at all organisational levels, but not for all traits. Both species increased their light interception efficiency in the understorey. Firstly, understorey trees produced relatively wide crowns because they did not favour the growth of shoots in the summit of the crown, as did gap trees. Secondly, they reduced self-shading (expressed by leaf area index) by lower sympodial unit production rates, lower leaf production rates per growth unit (only Vouacapoua), and smaller leaf size (only Dicorynia). The reduction in self-shading was weakened by other traits that had the opposite effect on self shading (e.g. longer leaf life span in understorey), and cannot be considered an adaptive response in itself. (3) Understorey trees of Vouacapoua reduced leaf display costs by producing a higher specific leaf area, a shorter space among leaves, a smaller leaf spacing to leaf size ratio, and a longer leaf life span. Thus, all traits contributed to the more economical use of carbon in the understorey. Dicorynia showed the same trends, but not significantly.These results suggest that light availability plays a major role in the development and morphology of trees through its influences at multiple levels of organisation within the crown hierarchy. The two species studied were rather similar in their response at crown level, while they sometimes differed in their responses at the underlying lower organisational levels. The response directions of some individual plant traits were similar for the tall trees studied here and small saplings studied elsewhere. Some of traits investigated here may not be important in the crown level responses of smaller seedlings and saplings, while they are important mechanisms for crown level responses in taller trees.";;;;;;;;;31;0;27;1;31;1385-0237;;WOS:000082532000009;

These species were the needle-leaved pioneer Pinus massoniana and the broad-leaved shade-tolerant Castanopsis fargesii, Sloanea leptocarpa, and Elaeocarpus japonicus. The experimental outdoor light environments, which broadly simulated those in forest gaps and clearings, were 100, 55, 33, and 18% of incident light quantity. Mean relative growth rates for both total leaf area and stem height revealed interaction of season and light environment in Pinus, Castanopsis, and Elaeocarpus. In these species, mean relative growth rates were higher in summer in more shaded environments and in autumn in more exposed environments, but this shift was not as clear in Castanopsis. Winter growth was virtually nil in all species, although Pinus still achieved some winter stem height change. The hypothesis that late-successional rather than early-successional species would demonstrate interactions of season and light environment on growth and development was not sufficiently supported by the data. Variation in mean relative growth rates for total leaf area was due to changes in whole-plant average leaf size as well as leaf numbers. In Sloanea and Elaeocarpus seedlings in high light environments, reduced leaf size and enhanced leaf abscission rates gave rise to negative mean relative growth rates for total leaf area. The more sun-tolerant Castanopsis seedlings revealed no such leaf size response and shed few, if any, leaves in any of the light environments. These results indicate that seasonal variability in the growth response of tree seedlings to the light environment is an important factor to be taken into account in studies on gap dynamics of subtropical forests.;;;;;;;;;3;1;3;0;4;ao_t-26;;WOS:A1996UE62600014;

The survival and growth of 15 species and provenances of Australian trees planted on a saline site in dry tropical northern Australia was examined. The study site was divided between high, moderate and low salinity subsites. A randomized complete block design was used for each subsite.2. Tree survival and height were measured at 3 and 24 months. Measurements of diameter at breast height, tree crown size, branch number per tree, growth form, fork numbers per tree, and leaf length, width and thickness were conducted at 24 months. Soil salinity was measured at 3, 12 and 24 months. These data were statistically analysed to examine the effect of salinity on tree survival and growth and the differences in response between taxa.3. The survival and growth varied with salinity and species. Trees grown on the high salinity subsite had the lowest survival and poorest growth rate. Casuarina cunninghamiana, C. glauca and Eucalyptus camaldulensis achieved the highest survival, fastest growth rate and best growth form. Acacia aulacocarpa showed the poorest performance.4. It is suggested that species selection for utilization of saline sites should be made according to salinity, species salt tolerance and management objectives. Plant height and diameter, crown size and branch number are important characteristics which indicate salt tolerance. Those species with an ability to maintain a relatively large crown and a high number of branches when subjected to salinity are most likely to be highly tolerant to salt.;;;;;;;;;14;2;14;0;17;0021-8901;;WOS:A1995TP22100014;

Trees were felled to create six cleared gaps of two sizes(8 x 12 m, 75 m(2); 16 x 24 m, 300 m(2)). Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gaps and additional understory sites 1 yr before gap creation. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance, and seedling survival and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release.Architectural variation increased greatly over the 3-yr period. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple C4. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant.Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis by these species differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large-gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north.Population-level assimilation vs. irradiance response curves exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most plot microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north, where red maple > striped maple.Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap understory microclimatic gradient. Since survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, our results suggest that there is some photosynthetic potential for gap partitioning among these three species of Acer.";;;;;;;;;76;0;71;1;76;d_c-58;;WOS:A1994PW55400014;

The influence of moisture stress on tree growth, foliage development and the incidence of insect herbivory in a native forest of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in southern New South Wales was examined. Trees standing within intermittently flooded waterways were compared with trees at an average of 7.5 and 37.5 m from the edge of the waterways.2. There was a threefold increase in plant moisture stress, expressed as xylem water pressure potential, as the distance from water increased to 37.5 m. Growth, expressed as change in diameter at breast height, fell significantly (1.2, 0.8, 0.1 cm, respectively) with increased distance (0, 7.5, 37.5 m) from the waterways. Crown condition also fell significantly. Mean leaf area was significantly reduced from 13.7 to 8.7 cm(2) with increasing distance from floodwater. On average, 13.9% of leaf area was lost via insect herbivory.3. There were significant correlations between moisture stress and trunk diameter increment, leaf area, potential leaf area, leaf length/width ratio and % leaf area lost to insect herbivory. Mean leaf area was strongly correlated with tree growth.4. Moisture stress appeared to influence tree growth rate and leaf size and shape but not the physiological foliage parameters of % total nitrogen, total terpenoid yield or % 1,8-cineole of total terpenoid yield. In moisture-stressed trees, increased herbivory appeared to be related to smaller leaf size and not to significant changes in the levels of foliar nitrogen or cineole.5. There were, however, two distinct populations of trees, independent of distance from the waterways, in relation to total foliar terpenoid and cineole content. One population produced a mean terpenoid yield (2.12% +/- 0.13 w/w, leaf dry wt) and cineole content (71.7% of total terpenoid yield), while the other had a significantly lower terpenoid yield (1.12% +/- 0.22) and cineole content (12.7% of total terpenoid yield). The higher oil-yielding trees were subjected to significantly less mean herbivory than trees with the lower total oil and cineole yields (11.4% and 18.0% leaf area missing, respectively). It is proposed that genetic selection of trees with high 1,8-cineole content will reduce insect herbivory.;;;;;;;;;39;1;35;1;43;0021-8901;;WOS:A1994PT07000002;

The prominent leaf scars are visible on trunks of mature trees and the distance between scars is highly correlated with the height growth rate when the leaves were produced. Relationships between height growth rate, internode length and light environment were determined from marked P. aspera saplings in a tropical wet lowland forest and used to infer the past growth histories of larger saplings and trees. Inferred growth rates were quite variable, both within and between individuals. Estimated passage times to grow from 0.7 to 2.2 m tall ranged from 0.6-23 y, with a mean of 4.4 y (N = 61). The study illustrates the importance of examining the distribution of growth rate over the length of the stem in addition to the more usual distribution of numbers of individuals per growth rate class. Species such as Pourouma, which respond strongly to light, complete much of their total juvenile growth during intervals of high light, even though most saplings are growing slowly in shade at any given time.;;;;;;;;;16;0;15;0;16;0266-4674;;WOS:A1993MM52300009;

Air pollution may stimulate the premature senescence and loss of poplar leaves, but little work has focused on understanding how pollution alters leaf growth. This report describes two experiments which address this question. When trees were grown in open-top chambers and exposed to ambient pollution, final leaf size was initially reduced compared with that achieved in filtered air. After approximately 8 weeks of exposure leaf growth rate and final leaf size were stimulated in ambient pollution compared with leaves in filtered air and this was associated with senescence and loss of older leaves. A biophysical analysis of leaf cell expansion revealed that the effective turgor for growth of young poplar leaves was large and declined with leaf age, reaching zero as the leaf stopped growing. Cell wall extensibility was also maximal in rapidly growing leaves and declined for older leaves. Exposure of poplars to 50 ppb O3 had no effect on leaf growth or the control of leaf cell expansion.;;;;;INTERNATIONAL CONF ON ACIDIC DEPOSITION, ITS NATURE AND IMPACTS : ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION AND FORESTS;SEP 16-21, 1990;"USDA, FOREST SERV; UK FORESTRY COMMISS";GLASGOW, SCOTLAND;6;0;6;0;6;0378-1127;;WOS:A1992JP76600016;

We tested tree quality with bioassays using several leaf-eating insect species to study the impact of plant variation on herbivore performance.Leaf size and phenology varied considerably between years. Differences among trees were significant, but individual trees retained their leaf-character-ranking within and between seasons. Positive correlations between tree height and leaf size and differences in bud growth patterns indicate that the mountain is genetically related to the dwarf birch, B. nana. On tall, large-leaved trees, which flushed early in spring, herbivores grew fast, whereas lower nana-like trees with smaller leaves leafing out late represented poor quality food. This pattern varied between years, being stronger in a summer when the trees produced relatively small poor quality leaves than in a summer when the trees produced larger leaves on which the herbivores grew faster. However, the mean growth rates of herbivores on individual trees were significantly correlated between the years. In general, tree quality seems to depend on the temperature conditions of the previous summer, although a current year's high temperatures may mould leaf quality by altering the maturation pattern of the leaves. Polymorphism within a mountain birch population may be partially maintained by conflicting selection pressures: periods with advantageous climatic conditions and low herbivore pressure should favour taller, large-leaved trees, whereas the episodes of high herbivore pressure should favour low, small-leaved trees.;;;;;;;;;45;0;43;0;45;0030-1299;;WOS:A1992HL78900008;

These were sown in theMSU forest tree nursery at E. Lansing, Michigan in the spring of 1959 and were grown there for 3 years. A modified randomized block design with 4 replications was used. In genetic terminology the experiment was a series of half-sib progeny tests, with each seedlot representing a half-sib family. Each set of measurements was subjected to analysis of variance. The mean squares were separated into plot X replicate interaction (= [sigma]2e), family-within-stand (= [sigma]2-p) and between-stand (= [sigma]2S) variances. Family heritabilities were calculated accord ing to the formula: Family heritability = [image]. Inter-character correlations were calculated separately for each stand, using progeny means as items. For most of the 9 stands there was a significant amount of between-family variation in growth rate, date of first-year bud formation, and presence of secondary leaves in Oct. 1959. Foliage color on various dates and leaf length were genetically variable traits in which the amount of between-family variation differed considerably among stands. Family heritabilities of the 5 most variable traits ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 in the East German and Belgian populations. In the East German but not in the Belgian population between-stand differences in several traits were significant. Significant between-stand differences mean that stand selection would be an effective improvement measure. The repeatability of the relative height differences for countries, stands, and families was high during the 3-year test period. Repeatability estimates were also made from the 8 color determinations. Between countries the color trends did not change appreciably. As regards family-within-stand color differences there were several reversals in trend from the 1st to the 2nd autumn and from summer to autumn, but none from the 2nd to the 3rd autumn. Improvement by selection of families which excel in one trait seems relatively simple. Both selection differential and heritability could be high enough to assure detectable progress. Simultaneous selection for 2 traits is also possible but would usually entail a serious sacrifice in selection differential in one or the other trait. No families were found which deviated significantly from the stand average in 3 or more traits. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;;;BCI:BCI19644500044078;

Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size.2. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts.3. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts.4. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density.5. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components.;;;;;;;;;17;3;19;1;21;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200015;

Consequently, subsequent observations, sampled in the environmental archive, can be inversed on the time axis, resulting in a non-physical signal model. In this paper an optimization technique with linear constraints on the signal model parameters is proposed that prevents time inversions. The activation conditions for this constrained optimization are based upon the physical constraint of the growth rate, namely, that it cannot take values smaller than zero. The actual constraints are defined for polynomials and first-order splines as basis functions for the nonlinear contribution in the distance-time relationship. The method is compared with an existing method that eliminates the time inversions, and its noise sensitivity is tested by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the usefulness of the method is demonstrated on the measurements of the vessel density, in a mangrove tree, Rhizophora mucronata, and the measurement of Mg/Ca ratios, in a bivalve, Mytilus trossulus.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1874-8961;;WOS:000293473100003;

Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density.Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk.Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field.

The variation in anatomical and hydraulic characteristics of branches was considered from three perspectives: vertically within a crown (lower, middle and upper crown), radially along main branches (proximal, middle and distal part), and with respect to branch orders (first-, second- and third-order branches). Hydraulically weighted mean diameter of vessels (D (h)) and theoretical specific conductivity of the xylem (k (t)) exhibited no vertical trend within the tree crown, whereas leaf-specific conductivity of the xylem (LSCt) decreased acropetally. Variation in LSCt was governed by sapwood area to leaf area ratio (Huber value) rather than by changes in xylem anatomy. The acropetal increase in soil-to-leaf conductance (G (T)) within the birch canopy is attributable to longer path length within the lower-crown branches and higher hydraulic resistance of the shade leaves. D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, while vessel density (VD) and relative area of vessel lumina (VA) increased distally along main branches. A strong negative relationship between vessel diameter and VD implies a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability of xylem. D (h) and VD combined explained 85.4% of the total variation of k (t) in the regression model applied to the whole data set. Xylem in fast-growing branches (primary branches) had greater area of vessel lumina per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood, resulting in a positive relationship between branch radial growth rate and k (t). D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, whereas VD increased with increasing branch order. This pattern promotes the hydraulic dominance of primary branches over the secondary branches and their dominance over tertiary branches. In this way crown architecture contributes to preferential water flow along the main axes, potentially providing better water supply for the branch apical bud and foliage located in the outer, better-insolated part of the crown.;;;;;;;;;14;1;12;0;15;0931-1890;;WOS:000254240300009;

This investigation examined the potential use of vessel density as a proxy for soil water salinity in the mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata (Rhizophoraceae) from Kenya.Methods In a time-standardized approach, 50 wood discs from trees growing in six salinity categories were investigated. Vessel densities, and tangential and radial diameters of rainy and dry season wood of one distinct year, at three positions on the stem discs, were measured. A repeated-measures ANOVA with the prevailing salinity was performed.Key Results Vessel density showed a significant increase with salinity, supporting its use as a prospective measure of salinity. Interestingly, the negative salinity response of the radial diameter of vessels was less striking, and tangential diameter was constant under the varying environmental conditions. An effect of age or growth rate or the presence of vessel dimorphism could be excluded as the cause of the absence of any ecological trend.Conclusions The clear trend in vessel density with salinity, together with the absence of a growth rate and age effect, validates the potential of vessel density as an environmental proxy. However, it can only be used as a relative measure of salinity given that other environmental variables such as inundation frequency have an additional influence on vessel density. With view to a reliable, absolute proxy, future research should focus on finding wood anatomical features correlated exclusively with soil water salinity or inundation frequency. The plasticity in vessel density with differing salinity suggests a role in the establishment of a safe water transport system. To confirm this hypothesis, the role of inter-vessel pits, their relationship to the rather constant vessel diameter and the underlying physiology and cell biology needs to be examined.;;;;;;;;;20;0;20;0;21;0305-7364;;WOS:000242245400021;17062590

Functional groups of species may differ in any of these traits, potentially resulting in (1) differences in mean RGR of groups, and (2) differences in the traits driving RGR variation within each group. We tested these predictions by comparing deciduous and evergreen savanna trees.Methods RGR, changes to biomass allocation and leaf morphology, and root non-structural carbohydrate reserves were evaluated for juveniles of 51 savanna species (34 deciduous, 17 evergreen) grown in a common garden experiment. It was anticipated that drivers of RGR would differ between leaf habit groups because deciduous species have to allocate carbohydrates to storage in roots to be able to flush leaves again, which directly compromises their LMF, whereas evergreen species are not subject to this constraint.Key Results Evergreen species had greater LMF and RGR than deciduous species. Among deciduous species LMF explained 27% of RGR variation (SLA 34% and NAR 29 %), whereas among evergreen species LMF explained between 2 and 17% of RGR variation (SLA 32-35% and NAR 38-62 %). RGR and LMF were (negatively) related to carbohydrate storage only among deciduous species.Conclusions Trade-offs between investment in carbohydrate reserves and growth occurred only among deciduous species, leading to differences in relative contribution made by the underlying components of RGR between the leaf habit groups. The results suggest that differences in drivers of RGR occur among savanna species because these have different selected strategies for coping with fire disturbance in savannas. It is expected that variation in the drivers of RGR will be found in other functional types that respond differently to particular disturbances.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0305-7364;;WOS:000340434200011;24958787

Two canopy species with contrasting functional traits dominating early and late successional stages, respectively, in a tropical montane rain forest of Hainan Island, China, were selected in a pot experiment under 4 levels of light intensity (full, 50%, 30%, and 10%) in order to explore the adaptive strategies of tropical trees to light conditions. Under each light intensity level, the pioneer species, Endospermum chinense (Euphorbiaceae), had higher relative growth rate (RGR), stem mass ratio (SMR), specific leaf area (SLA), and morphological plasticity while the shade tolerant climax species, Parakmeria lotungensis (Magnoliaceae), had higher root mass ratio (RMR) and leaf mass ratio (LMR). RGR of both species was positively related to SMR and SLA under each light level but was negatively correlated with RMR under lower light (30% and 10% full light). The climax species increased its survival by a conservative resource use strategy through increasing leaf defense and root biomass investment at the expense of growth rate in low light. In contrast, the pioneer increased its growth by an exploitative resource use strategy through increasing leaf photosynthetic capacity and stem biomass investment at the expense of survival under low light. There was a trade-off between growth and survival for species under different light conditions. Our study suggests that tree species in the tropical rainforest adopt different strategies in stands of different successional stages. Species in the earlier successional stages have functional traits more advantageous to grow faster in the high light conditions, whereas species in the late successional stages have traits more favorable to survive in the low light conditions.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;MEDLINE:25019095;25019095

Location Arid scrubland, Atacama desert, north-central Chile. Methods One-week-old seedlings of six coastal desert shrub species (Centaurea chilensis, Encelia canescens, Flourensia thurifera, Pleocarphus revolutus, Senna cumingii and Haplopappus parvifolius) were planted in the field under six treatment combinations: three light environments (low, intermediate and high radiation) and two water levels (natural rainfall (55.4mm) and natural rainfall plus 100mm irrigation). We quantified seedling survival for each species during 22weeks, estimated relative growth rate, and examined how light and water affect whole-plant responses, particularly specific leaf area, leaf mass ratio and rootshoot ratio. Results We found species-specific differences in the temporal pattern of mortality. Water and/or light levels affected seedling survival of all species, excluding C. chilensis. Relative growth rate (RGR) increased in low-light conditions in C. chilensis and P. revolutus, but otherwise did not vary in response to differences in either light or water, independently or to their interaction. Across species, the effect of water on specific leaf area (SLA) was inconsistent, increasing both in drought conditions (C. chilensis) and in treatments with supplemental water (S. cumingii). Additionally, SLA tended to increase with decreasing light levels for most species (F. thurifera, H. parvifolius, C. chilensis). In our study, only F. thrurifera and C. chilensis showed changes in leaf mass ratio (LMR) and only with respect to light levels; specifically, LMR tended to increase with decreasing light level. Biomass allocation was independent of light and water for all species except F. thurifera, which showed an increase in root biomass in drought conditions. Conclusions Overall, we did not find evidence to support a trade-off between drought and shade tolerance during early plant establishment. Our results suggest that water is the most important resource that limits recruitment in the coastal desert. Therefore, increased aridity in this system is likely to severely hinder seedling recruitment of the native coastal desert shrubs.";;;;;;;;;2;1;2;0;3;1100-9233;;WOS:000310798600006;

By measuring gas exchange, quantum efficiency of photosystem 2 (PSII), and growth parameters, we investigated the combined effects of flooding gradients and light on two common evergreen floodplain tree species, the light-tolerant Cecropia latiloba and the shade-tolerant Pouteria glomerata. Individual plants were subjected to different combinations of light and flooding intensity in short-term and long-term experiments. Plants of C latiloba lost all their leaves under total submersion treatments (plants flooded to apex and with reduced irradiance) and showed highest maximum assimilation rates (A(max)) in not flooded, high light treatments (6.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). Individuals of P. glomerata showed similar patterns, with A(max) increasing from 1.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) under total flooding to 7.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in not flooded, high light treatments. During the long-term flooding experiment, quantum efficiency of PSII (F-v/ F-m)of C. latiloba was not affected by partial flooding. In contrast, in P. glomerata F-v/F-m decreased to values below 0.73 after 120 days of total flooding. Moreover, total submergence led P. glomerata to reduce significantly light saturation point (LSP), as compared to C. latiloba. For both species morphological adjustments to long-term flooding, such as the production of adventitious roots, resulted in reduced total biomass, relative growth rate (RGR) and leaf mass ratio (LMR). Growth increase in C. latiloba seemed to be more limited bylaw-light than by flooding. Therefore, the predominant occurrence of this species is in open areas with high light intensities and high levels of inundation. In P. glomerata flooding induced high reductions of growth and photosynthesis, whereas light was not limiting. This species is more abundant in positions where irradiance is reduced and periods of submergence are slightly modest. We could show that the physiological requirements are directly responsible for the flooding (C. latiloba) and shade (P. glomerata) tolerance of the two species, which explains their local distribution in Amazonian floodplain forests.

I found that (i) the spatial heterogeneity across the transect was greater than the temporal heterogeneity at any given microsite on the transect for both light and water and there was a positive correlation between them, (ii) Couepia obovata Ducke, the largest seeded and the only subcanopy tree, survived the best and showed both the largest relative height growth rate (RHGR) and the largest specific leaf area (SLA), while among the two early successional trees, Tapirira guianensis J.B.

Dose-response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length ( stem length : stem mass).

The ability to display functional responses to shading, i.e. phenotypic changes that enhance plant performance in low light, is fundamental for plant success in forest communities. Herbivory may constrain plant functional responses to shading and this could explain the often observed lower plant tolerance of herbivore damage in the shade.2. We carried out a field trial and a greenhouse experiment to evaluate whether simulated herbivory (i) causes greater fitness losses in the shade, and (ii) modifies plant functional responses to shading. Changes in functional traits were measured at the biochemical, leaf, shoot and whole-plant levels, in seedlings of the light-demanding evergreen tree Aristotelia chilensis (Elaeocarpaceae), which is endemic to South American austral forests.3. We hypothesized that plant responses to shade would be constrained by herbivory due to within-plant limitations in resource availability and/or antagonistic interactions between responses to shade and herbivory. We further expected that this limitation would result in a greater field mortality of damaged plants in forest understory as compared to open sites.4. Simulated herbivory (50% defoliation) on field seedlings decreased 8-month plant survival in the shade (forest understory) but not in the sun (canopy gaps) in a temperate rainforest. Likewise, simulated herbivory in the greenhouse decreased plant growth rate and final biomass in the shade treatment but not in the sun treatment.5. The phenotypic responses to shading of seven traits were constrained by simulated herbivory: chlorophyll, leaf shape, leaf blade angle, petiole angle, SLA (specific leaf area), internodes length and total leaf area. A path-analysis showed that most of these constrained responses were uncorrelated to each other. Some of these results might be explained by antagonistic interactions between molecules or pathways involved in plant responses to shading and herbivory. Four functional traits exhibited greater responses to shading in damaged plants: A(max) (Photosynthetic rate), foliar carbon, shoot : root ratio and LMR (leaf mass ratio); but most of them resulted from correlated changes in SLA.6. The present study undertook a mechanistic approach to the often observed pattern of greater impact of herbivore damage on plant performance in low light environments. The central finding of this study is that the unraveling of herbivory-constrained plant functional responses to shading may explain the often observed greater fitness losses due to herbivory in the shade. It is also suggested that herbivory pressure is an underestimated factor in pioneer species distribution along the light gradient.";;;;;;;;;7;1;7;1;8;0269-8463;;WOS:000290174500007;

This study was designed to characterize growth and light requirements of six common neotropical tree species Pseudosamanea guachapele (Fabaceae), Tabebuia impetiginosa (Bignoniaceae), Ceiba pentandra (Bombacaceae), Pachira quinata (Bombacaceae). Dalbergia retusa (Fabaceae), and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) in an abandoned pasture under contrasting light environments and grass competition. Field studies were conducted in the pastures of the Santa Ana Conservation Center in Costa Rica. Two differing grass competition sites were selected, one dominated by a tall grass, Hyparrhenia rub a and another dominated by a short grass, Cynodon mlenfluensis. Three light treatments were created (2,37 and 100% light) using either neutral shade cloth (2 and 37%) or no shade cloth (100%). Growth characteristics and biomass partitioning of the seedlings were measured. Species differed in their relative growth rates (RGRs). The light x species interaction was significant at both sites. While all species had similar performance under 100% light on both short grass and tall grass sites, species growth differences were evident under 37 and 2% light levels. For example, at the short grass site, T. rosea had higher RGR than D. retusa and P. quinata under 2% light whereas both Tabebuia species performed better than other species at the tall grass site. The general trend was to increase root mass ratio and decrease leaf mass ratio with increasing levels of light. As an initial step for restoring abandoned pasture lands we recommend using all these species in direct and moderate light conditions. Incorporating all species will create a more heterogeneous environment. Choosing light demanding species that can tolerate grass competition may help ensure success in the early stage of restoration.

Predicting species' responses to neighbors based on readily measurable functional traits would provide important insight into the factors that structure plant communities. We measured a suite of functional traits on seedlings of 20 species and mature plants of 54 species of shrubs from three arid biogeographic regions. We hypothesized that species with different regeneration niches-those that require nurse plants for establishment (beneficiaries) versus those that do not (colonizers)-are functionally different. Indeed, seedlings of beneficiary species had lower relative growth rates, larger seeds and final biomass, allocated biomass toward roots and height at a cost to leaf mass fraction, and constructed costly, dense leaf and root tissues relative to colonizers. Likewise at maturity, beneficiaries had larger overall size and denser leaves coupled with greater water use efficiency than colonizers. In contrast to current hypotheses that suggest beneficiaries are less ""stress-tolerant"" than colonizers, beneficiaries exhibited conservative functional strategies suited to persistently dry, low light conditions beneath canopies, whereas colonizers exhibited opportunistic strategies that may be advantageous in fluctuating, open microenvironments. In addition, the signature of the regeneration niche at maturity indicates that facilitation expands the range of functional diversity within plant communities at all ontogenetic stages. This study demonstrates the utility of specific functional traits for predicting species' regeneration niches in hot deserts, and provides a framework for studying facilitation in other severe environments.";;;;;;;;;12;0;12;1;12;0029-8549;;WOS:000286224900021;20686787

Some explanations emphasize traits enhancing net carbon gain; others emphasize energy conservation traits such as storage of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). To date, cross-species studies have provided mixed support for the role of NSC storage in low-light survival. We examined NSC status, survival, biomass, and growth of large seedlings of two evergreen species of differing shade tolerance (Nothofagus nitida and N. dombeyi) grown in deep shade and 50% light for two growing seasons. We expected to find higher NSC concentration in the more shade-tolerant N. nitida and since allocation to storage involves sacrificing growth, higher growth rate in the shade-intolerant N. dombeyi. NSC concentration of both species was > twofold higher in 50% light than in deep shade, and in roots and stems did not differ significantly between species in either environment. NSC contents per plant were also similar between dead and living plants in deep shade. N. dombeyi outgrew N. nitida in 50% light, while this pattern was reversed in deep shade. Survival in deep shade was not correlated with NSC concentration. Leaf mass fraction was similar between species in 50% light, but lower in N. dombeyi in deep shade. Results provide little evidence of a link between carbohydrate storage and low-light survival in Nothofagus species, and support the view that understorey survival is primarily a function of net carbon gain. Patterns of variation in NSC concentration of the temperate species we studied are likely dominated by more important influences than adaptation to shade, such as limitation of growth or adaptation to cold stress.";;;;;;;;;11;2;9;0;13;0912-3814;;WOS:000270837500008;

Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR). The mean values of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P (nmax)) in 25 and 5% daylight were 12.8 and 8.0 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for G. integrifolia and 17.9 and 7.4 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for S. terebinthifolius. Based on the measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density and estimated values of photosynthetic saturated irradiance (Is) we concluded that, in all shaded conditions, the leaves of both species were under sub optimal light conditions to reach P (nmax). In spite of the lowest P (nmax) values, RGR and NAR were significantly higher for G. integrifolia in all irradiance levels. Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.;;;;;;;;;5;1;2;2;7;0167-4366;;WOS:000268865600005;

Germination conditions were evaluated through the effect of log hardness, moss height, light condition, and shading by taller seedlings on fallen logs, and shade tolerance was evaluated by physiological and morphological traits and survival dynamics in a natural coniferous forest. In contrast to P. jezoensis, the number of germinated seedlings of A. sachalinensis increased with moss height. The number of germinated seedlings decreased with shading only in P. jezoensis. Consequently, it is suggested that germination of P. jezoensis is limited to fresh, recently fallen logs. The survival rate of A. sachalinensis under low-light conditions (< 5% of relative photosynthetic photon flux density) was higher than that of P. jezoensis. Abies sachalinensis had a higher leaf mass ratio (total leaf mass/total mass) and leaf area ratio (total leaf area/total mass) than P. jezoensis. In conclusion, earlier establishment of P. jezoensis on fallen logs and higher shade tolerance of A. sachalinensis are suggested to contribute to the coexistence of these 2 species.;;;;;;;;;1;0;2;0;2;1195-6860;;WOS:000270372000008;

We analyzed responsiveness to light and nutrient availability of five Bauhinia species (three lianas and two trees). Seedlings were grown in a shade house in two light regimes (5 and 25% Of full Sunlight) and two nutrient Supply regimes (field soil and N fertilization equivalent to 100 kg ha(-1)), and important growth-related physiological and morphological plant parameters were measured. Light availability affected most of the measured variables, whereas N addition had only weak effects. In the four light-demanding species (two lianas and two trees), relative plant biomass growth rate increased and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with increased light availability, whereas a shade-tolerant liana did not respond. Leaf N concentration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area increased in response to increased irradiance or soil N in the light-demanding tree species and the shade-tolerant liana, but not in the two light-demanding lianas. The light-demanding lianas also had higher SLA and leaf mass ratio, resulting in a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) in high light, whereas the light-demanding trees did not. Across all treatments, mean plasticity indices of physiological and morphological traits, and all traits combined were similar among the studied species. Plasticity was higher in response to light than to N, indicating that light is the main factor controlling seedling responses of the Studied species. Although lianas and trees did not differ in mean plasticity in response to light and N, the light-demanding lianas were phenotypically less plastic in LAR and in photosynthetic rates and biomass allocation than the trees. Light and N interacted in their effects on most physiological variables, but the consequences for relative growth rate differed little among species. We conclude that, contrary to Our predictions, lianas were no more responsive to variation in light and N availability than trees.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0829-318X;;WOS:000258841300014;18519259

We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.";;;;;;;;;26;1;24;1;27;1445-4408;;WOS:000259306500007;

As a result these two groups of woody species will have different spatial distributions: lianas are more common in high light environments. This study determines the differences in growth patterns, biomass allocation and leaf traits in five closely related liana and tree species of the genus Bauhinia.Methods Seedlings of two light-demanding lianas (Bauhinia tenuiflora and B. claviflora), one shade-tolerant liana (B. aurea), and two light-demanding trees (B. purpurea and B. monandra) were grown in a shadehouse at 25 % of full sunlight. A range of physiological, morphological and biomass parameters at the leaf and whole plant level were compared among these five species.Key Results The two light-demanding liana species had higher relative growth rate (RGR), allocated more biomass to leaf production [higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and higher leaf area ratio (LAR)] and stem mass fraction (SMF), and less biomass to the roots [root mass fraction (RMF)] than the two tree species. The shade-tolerant liana had the lowest RGR of all five species, and had a higher RMF, lower SMF and similar LMF than the two light-demanding liana species. The two light-demanding lianas had lower photosynthetic rates per unit area (A(area)) and similar photosynthetic rates per unit mass (A(mass)) than the trees. Across species, RGR was positively related to SLA, but not to LAR and A(area).Conclusions It is concluded that the faster growth of light-demanding lianas compared with light-demanding trees is based on morphological parameters (SLA, LMF and LAR), and cannot be attributed to higher photosynthetic rates at the leaf level. The shade-tolerant liana exhibited a slow-growth strategy, compared with the light-demanding species.;;;;;;;;;22;1;22;1;24;0305-7364;;WOS:000250663300015;17720978

Light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)) and light saturation estimates (LSE) reflected the species successional status with Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels, the pioneer species showing largest mean Amax and LSE at 100% sunlight, whereas at 10% sunlight, it showed the lowest A(max) and LSE. At 22% sunlight, Cedrela odorata L., an intermediate successional species had greater Amax and LSE than Mansonia altissima A. Chev., a non-pioneer light demander and T. superba. T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A(max)-mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F-v/F-m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species' short-term acclimation to high or low light.

Compared to CO2, light and water treatment had greater effects on all morphological traits measured (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, biomass fractions). Cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO2 under low-watered (W-) and high-illuminated conditions (L+). Allocation shifted from shoot to root under increasing irradiance (L+), but was not affected by CO2. Changes in allocation related to water limitation were only modest, and changed over time. Relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were significantly greatest in the L+/W+ treatment for both CO2 concentrations. Changes in RGR were mainly due to NAR. Growth responses to increased light, water or CO2 were strongest with light, medium with water availability and smallest for CO2, in terms of RGR. The rise in NAR for light and water treatments was counterbalanced by a decrease in SLA (specific leaf area) and LMF (leaf mass fraction). Results suggest that elevated CO2 caused cork oak seedlings to improve their performance in dry and high light environments to a greater extent than in well-irrigated and low light ones, thus ameliorating the effects of soil water stress and high light loads on growth.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0931-1890;;WOS:000242296600006;

Data were compiled consisting of 1240 observations (614 species) from 83 different experiments published in 37 different studies, in order to quantify the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR, g cm(-2) day(-1)), specific leaf area (SLA, cm(2) g(-1)) and leaf mass ratio (LMR, g g(-1)) in determining relative growth rate (RGR, g g(-1) day(-1)), and how these change with respect to daily quantum input (DQI, moles m(-2) day(-1)) and growth form (herbaceous or woody).2. Each of 1n(NAR), ln(SLA) and ln(LMR) were separately regressed on ln(RGR) using mixed model regressions in order to partition the between-experiment and within-experiment variation in slopes and intercepts. DQI and plant type were then added to these models to see if they could explain some of the between-experiment variation in the relative importance of each growth component.3. LMR was never strongly related to RGR. In general, NAR was the best general predictor of variation in RGR. However, for determining RGR the importance of NAR decreased, and the importance of SLA increased, with decreasing daily quantum input in experiments containing herbaceous species.

We tested for significant interactive effects of light and nutrient availabilities on foliage architecture, chemistry, biomass allocation and growth in shade intolerant temperate deciduous trees Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh. First-year seedlings were grown at four irradiance and four N and P availability combinations, and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. In both species, increases in light availability resulted in larger net assimilation rate (NAR, total plant biomass production rate per unit leaf area), root mass fraction (F-R) and leaf mass per unit area M-A but reductions in leaf area ratio (LAR, foliage area per total plant dry mass), stem mass fraction (F-S) and leaf mass fraction (F-L). The strong decrease in LAR (LAR = F-L/M-A) With light mainly resulted from increases in MA. The light-dependent increase in NAR was larger than the decline in LAR such that plant relative growth rate (RGR = NAR x LAR) scaled positively with light in both species. Nutrient availability mainly enhanced LAR, and moderately NAR, further improving RGR. The increase in LAR was primarily associated with increases in F-L and decreases in FR. Significant interactions between light and nutrients were found for most of the studied variables, overall indicating that plant allocation and growth were more responsive to nutrients at higher light availability. Several significant species and year-to-year differences were observed among the allocation and growth characteristics that were driven by plant size, climate and seedling source. Greater RGR of B. pubescens that is a species colonizing habitats with lower nutrient availability was linked to its greater foliage nitrogen concentrations. Overall, the study highlights a significant light x nutrient interaction that can modify seedling performance along natural gap-understory gradients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;21;1435-8603;;WOS:000232416400006;16163613

Seedlings were grown outdoors during summer under two irrigation treatments: field capacity and 35% of field capacity. The relative growth rate (RGR) strongly depended on the growth form, from highest values in herbs to lowest in woody perennials. The main component associated with interspecific variation in RGR was the specific leaf area (SLA), and a quantitative grouping of the different growth forms appeared along the regression line between both parameters. The slow-growing species, i.e. woody perennial shrubs, had the lowest SLA and the fast-growing perennial herbs, the highest, while woody semi-deciduous shrubs appeared intermediate. Decreases in RGR due to water stress were analysed in terms of the relative contribution of the leaf mass ratio (LMR), SLA and the net assimilation rate (NAR). Pooling all species, the decrease in RGR caused by water deficit was mainly explained by decreases in SLA. However, this general pattern was strongly dependent of growth form. Thus, in the woody perennial plants, the decrease in RGR was accompanied by a three-fold decrease in NAR which, however, increased in perennial herbs. SLA increased with decreasing water supply in woody perennial plants, and decreased in woody semi-deciduous shrubs and perennial herbs. Finally, decreases in LMR partly explained decreases in RGR in perennial herbs and woody perennial shrubs. This different response of the different growth forms may reflect differences in seedling adaptation and surviving strategies to drought periods.;;;;;;;;;32;1;30;0;34;0029-8549;;WOS:000231779500003;15868165

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and measures of invasiveness were positively associated across species as well as within phylogenetically independent contrasts. High RGR, small seed masses, and short generation times characterize pine species that are successful invaders in disturbed habitats. Discriminant analysis and logistic regression revealed that RGR was the most significant factor among these life-history traits separating invasive and noninvasive species. We also explored the causes of differences in RGR among invasive and noninvasive species. While net assimilation rate, leaf mass ratio, and specific leaf area (SLA) were all found to be contributing positively to RGR, SLA was found to be the main component responsible for differences in RGR between invasive and noninvasive pines. We investigated differences in SLA further by studying leaf anatomy, leaf density, and leaf thickness. We also evaluated relative leaf production rate as an important aspect of SLA.

Previous studies on the combined effects of light and nutrient supply on the growth rates of plants have involved adding nutrients to soils to levels rarely (or never) met by the plants in nature. As a better test of the likely response of plants to root competition for nutrients. we grew for 1 year seedlings of six species of Australian rainforest tree on forest topsoil undiluted and on soil diluted 50/50, 25/75 and 5/95 with coarse sand. Seedlings were grown in tall tubes in 6 and 9% daylight, equivalent to gap-edge and gap-centre conditions.2. The six species varied in their light requirements for establishment and onward growth.3. One species grew significantly and markedly more quickly on soil diluted 50/50 with sand (Elaeocarpus grandis). Improved aeration is the most likely explanation.4. The extent of inhibition by soil dilution correlated positively with the absolute amount of new dry mass accreted in one year, whether the larger accretion resulted from a combination of high relative growth rate (RGR) and small embryo size, or moderate RGR and larger embryo size.5. Soil dilution generally reduced leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio, but had no significant effect on specific leaf area.6. In all species the overall concentration of nitrogen in the whole plant declined with soil dilution, in the four species tested, N concentration in leaves declined, and it is likely that the reduction in growth arose partly from a reduced unit leaf rate. Most species showed increases in the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg with soil dilution, or no change, but in Diploglottis bracteata the concentrations of Ca and Mg, especially in the older leaves, declined markedly with soil dilution, and one of these cations could have been limiting growth.7. Extrapolation of the results to the field suggests that in single-treefall gaps the fastest growing species will the most inhibited by root competition.8. The soil-dilution technique is likely to be more appropriate than nutrient addition as an indicator of sensitivity to root competition on a given soil.;;;;;;;;;8;0;8;0;9;0269-8463;;WOS:000175467600009;

For economically important species like the ornamental plant Ficus benjamina (Moraceae) it would be advantageous if such a limitation could be partly overcome in order to reduce growing periods. To identify the physiological causes for the low relative growth rate of this species, we compared it with three species of taxonomically related families: Musanga cecropioides (Moraceae), a fast-growing tropical pioneer tree; Cannabis sativa (Cannabaceae), a ruderal herb; and Pilea nummularifolia (Urticaceae), a tropical forest understorey herb. Relative growth rate at similar plant size was about half for F benjamina (65 mg(-1) day(-1)) as compared to the other tree species and the two herbaceous species (113-137 mg(-1) day(-1)), due mainly to differences in leaf area ratio (LAR; 15.9 vs. 25.9-34.1 m(2) kg(-1)). Net assimilation rates were neither different, nor were measured rates of leaf photosynthesis, The differences in LAR were brought about by differences in leaf morphology/anatomy rather than differences in biomass allocation to leaves: specific leaf area (SLA) of F. benjamina was much lower (28.9 vs. 46.6-52.7 m(2) kg(-1)), whereas leaf mass ratio (LMR) was not. Both leaf thickness and dry matter fraction varied among species, but E benjamina was the only species with high values for both variables, and hence had the lowest SLA. The two trees did not show higher investment in woody stems. We conclude that at similar size woody plants do not necessarily have lower growth rates than herbaceous plants. SLA is a key trait determining growth rate, Selection for higher SLA may enhance productivity, but caution is warranted due to likely reductions in leaf life-span and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress.

The main objective of this study was to test the association between leaf turnover rate and RGR, specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry weight) and other growth variables. Plants were grown for 6 months in a greenhouse under favourable water and nutrient conditions. Variation in RGR among the 16 woody species was due mainly to differences in morphological parameters such as leaf area ratio (LAR, whole plant area/whole plant dry weight) and SLA). However, temporal variation in RGR within species was due mainly to variation in net assimilation rate. When phylogeny was not taken into account. analyses showed that deciduous species grew faster than evergreens. In contrast, when phylogeny was taken into account. the data analysis showed that a faster RGR is not consistently associated with the deciduous habit (in five pairs it was, but in the other three it was not). The faster growth of the deciduous trees (in the five positive contrasts) could be explained by their higher LAR and higher SLA relative to evergreens. The lack of differences in RGR between deciduous and evergreens (in three pairs) was due to the higher leaf mass ratio (LMR, leaf dry biomass/total dry biomass) for the evergreens. which offset the higher SLA of the deciduous species, resulting in a similar LAR in both functional groups (LAR=LMRxSLA). Deciduous species had consistently higher SLA than evergreens. We suggest that SLA, more than RGR. could be an important parameter in determining adaptive advantages of deciduous and evergreen species.;;;;;;;;;65;3;61;3;73;0029-8549;;WOS:000170392500003;

The consistency of relationships between RGR and its component attributes leaf nitrogen productivity (LNP), leaf N per area (LNCa), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) was assessed across 12 datasets comprising three growth forms (grasses, herbaceous dicots and woody plants; 250 species in total). These relationships were characterised in terms of scaling slopes (regressions on log-log axes, the slopes giving the proportional relationship between the variables). Mathematically, the expected scaling slope between RGR and each component is 1.0, giving an appropriate null hypothesis to test against (whereas the widely used null hypothesis of zero correlation is in fact inappropriate for this situation). Deviations below 1:1 scaling slopes indicate negative covariance between the components. Consequently, the correlation structure between the components of RGR should also be investigated. Biologically, RGR should scale 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa and somewhat more weakly with LNCa at a given SLA. SLA and LNCa should themselves scale with a slope of between 0 and -1, with the actual slope indicating the extent to which between-species variation in SLA dilutes leaf N on an area basis versus the ability of species to maintain LNCa at a given growth irradiance. On average, across the 12 datasets RGR scaled close-to-proportionally with SLA, and 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa. RGR scaled with LNCa with null or negative slopes, since SLA and LNCa scaled negatively (with slopes generally shallower than -1); however, RGR scaled positively (but less than proportionally) with LNCa at a given SLA. For these key relationships there were no qualitatively different conclusions with respect to the growth form under consideration or the growth irradiance at which the seedlings were grown. RGR also scaled close-to-proportionally with LNP, while LNP and LNCa were negatively associated. These relationships involving LNP are difficult to interpret since it can be shown that they are, at least potentially, the result of the interactions between RGR, SLA and LNCa, as well as reflecting intrinsic differences in the efficiency of nitrogen use in the growth process.";;;;;;;;;51;3;49;3;56;0029-8549;;WOS:000167629200003;

Sapling growth of six rain forest tree species was compared to evaluate whether species respond in a similar way to a natural light gradient. Saplings were measured non-destructively; production and loss of leaves, stem and branches were analysed in detail.2. Sapling height growth was positively related to light environment and leaf area. No single descriptor of light environment explained sapling growth best. Direct or diffuse Light could explain plant growth, depending on species.3, Seventeen percent of the saplings had negative relative biomass growth rates, although they occurred in fairly bright conditions. Negative growth rates were caused by leaf shedding and stem breakage. Sapling relative growth rate increased with irradiance, mainly because of an increase in net assimilation rate.4. On a shoot basis, shaded plants had a smaller leaf mass fraction (LMF) and a larger specific leaf area, resulting in similar leaf area ratios (LAR) to those of sun plants. This contrasts with the results of seedling studies under controlled conditions, where LMF and LAR increased with shade.5. Biomass partitioning to leaf growth decreased with irradiance and relative growth rate of the sapling. This leaf partitioning ratio was better correlated with RGR than with irradiance.6. Species differed in the effect of light-dependent changes in specific leaf area (SLA) on growth. This underscores the importance of SLA in explaining differences in species performance in a forest environment.

Shading for 60 days had no effect on survival, but it influenced all growth parameters measured. Total biomass decreased with decreasing irradiance, reflecting reductions in dry mass of leaves, stems and roots. In response to shading, allocation of biomass to leaves increased, while allocation of biomass to roots decreased. Specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio increased with decreasing irradiance. Decreases in relative growth rate were caused by reductions in net assimilation rate rather than leaf area ratio. Photosynthetic efficiency, as determined by the F-v/F-m ratio (F-v = variable fluorescence, F-m = maximal fluorescence), was unaffected by the shading treatments. Partial removal of leaves, stem or roots did not affect seedling survival. Seedlings responded to removal of plant parts by compensatory growth.

The leaf traits analysed included density, thickness, saturated mass/dry mass, and leaf nitrogen per mass and per area. Other traits described the anatomy of leaves, most of them relating: to the lamina (proportions of palisade and spongy parenchymata, epidermis, air space and sclerified tissues, expressed as volume per leaf area, and per-cell transversal areas of epidermis and parenchymata), and another referring to the mid rib (transversal section of sclerified tissues). Across the whole set of species leaf mass per area was correlated with leaf density but not with thickness. and this was confirmed by taxonomic relatedness tests. Denser leaves corresponded with greater proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, smaller cells and lower water and N contents, but no relation was found with the proportion of air space in the lamina. Taxonomic relatedness analysis statistically supported the negative association of leaf density with saturated to dry leaf mass ratio. Thicker leaves also exhibited greater volume per leaf area and greater individual cell area in each of the tissues, particularly parenchyma. Mean leaf mass per area and leaf thickness were lower in deciduous than in evergreen species, but no significant differences in leaf density, proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina or cell area were found between the two groups. Leaf mass per area was higher in trees and subshrubs than in shrubs and climbers-plus-scramblers, this rank being equal for leaf density and proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, and reversed for cell area. Given the standardised environment and ontogenetic phase of the seedlings, we conclude that variation in leaf structure and anatomy among species and species groups has a strong genetic basis, and is already expressed early in the development of woody plants. From an ecological viewpoint, we can interpret greater leaf mass per area across this species set as greater allocation to support and defence functions, as shown predominantly by species from resource-poor environments.;;;;;;;;;99;25;93;4;128;0029-8549;;WOS:000089509700002;

Does enhanced whole-plant CO2 exchange in moderately low to high light occur at the cost of greater CO2 loss rates at very-low light levels? We examined this question for first-year seedlings of intolerant Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera, intermediate Betula alleghaniensis, and tolerant Ostrya virginiana and Acer saccharum grown in moderately low (7.3% of open-sky) and low (2.8%) light. We predicted that, compared with shade-tolerant species, intolerant species would have characteristics leading to greater whole-plant CO2 exchange rates in moderately low to high light levels, and to higher CO2 loss rates at very-low light levels.2. Compared with shade-tolerant A. saccharum, less-tolerant species grown in both light treatments had greater mass-based photosynthetic rates, leaf, stem and root respiration rates, leaf mass:plant mass ratios and leaf area:leaf mass ratios, and similar whole-plant light compensation points and leaf-based quantum yields.3. Whole-plant CO2 exchange responses to light (0.3-600 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) indicated that intolerant species had more positive CO2 exchange rates at all but very-low light (< 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast, although tolerant A. saccharum had a net CO2 exchange disadvantage at light > 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), its lower respiration resulted in lower CO2 losses than other species at light < 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1).4. Growth scaled closely with whole-plant CO2 exchange characteristics and especially with integrated whole-plant photosynthesis (i.e. leaf mass ratio x in situ leaf photosynthesis). In contrast, growth scaled poorly with leaf-level quantum yield, light compensation point, and light-saturated photosynthetic rate.5. Collectively these patterns indicated that: (a) no species was able to both minimize CO2 loss at very-low light (i.e. < 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and maximize CO2 gain at higher light (i.e. > 15 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), because whole-plant respiration rates were positively associated with whole-plant photosynthesis at higher light; (b) shade-intolerant species possess traits that maximize whole-plant CO2 exchange (and thus growth) in moderately low to high light levels, but these traits may lead to long-term growth and survival disadvantages in very-low light (< 2.8%) owing, in part, to high respiration. In contrast, shade-tolerant species may minimize CO2 losses in very-low light at the expense of maximizing CO2 gain potential at higher light levels, but to the possible benefit of long-term survival in low light.";;;;;;;;;57;4;51;1;61;0269-8463;;WOS:000087845800002;

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, SLA), net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, NARa) and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, LMR). Commonly, most cross-species variation in RGR is accounted for by variation in SLA, while no general relationships occur between RGR and either NARa or LMR. NARa can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, LNP) and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, LNCa). In this way the influence on RGR of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated.2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in SLA, LNP, LNCa and LMR explained c. 44%, 22%, 19% and 15% of variation in RGR, respectively. SLA and LNP were positively associated with RGR, while LNCa was negatively associated with RGR. LNP and LNCa were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between RGR and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between RGR and NARa. It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between NARa and RGR.3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' (NAR) and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, NUR). At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low RGR tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be co-ordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with RGR across all species.;;;;;;;;;47;21;49;2;71;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500013;

We tested this model by quantitatively reviewing growth, leaf lifespan, CO2 exchange and morphological data from 76 studies on woody seedlings grown under conditions of low light. Data were placed into three tolerance categories (intolerant, intermediate, tolerant), two light categories (less than 4% and 4-12%) and two leaf phenology categories (broad-leaved evergreen and winter deciduous). For both evergreen and deciduous groups, intolerant species had traits conferring greater growth potential than tolerant species in both light categories. These traits included greater leaf mass ratio, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and mass-based photosynthetic rates above light compensation. However, in 0-4% light, growth rates were similar for intolerant and tolerant species, because low light together with higher respiration rates for intolerant species limited the expression of their growth potential differences. Deciduous and evergreen intolerant species were similar in many respects. However, both intermediate and tolerant deciduous species had markedly lower leaf mass ratios and higher root mass ratios than intermediate and tolerant evergreen species. In addition, deciduous species and intolerant evergreens must cope with as much as sixfold higher leaf turnover rates than tolerant evergreen species. Thus, rather than maximizing growth rates in low light, tolerant evergreen species minimize biomass loss through long leaf lifespans and low respiration rates. Tolerant deciduous species also minimize biomass losses by minimizing whole-plant respiration rates but they accomplish low biomass turnover though low leaf mass ratio and not low leaf turnover rates. Furthermore, unlike most tropical evergreens, tolerant deciduous species can gain large fractions of their total growing season carbon during short periods when the overstory is leafless and then allocate this carbon to storage (as reflected by high root mass ratios) rather than new leaves. In conclusion, we found no support for the low-light-enhanced carbon capture model of shade tolerance as viewed strictly from the perspective of physiological growth capacity. This can be explained by the disadvantages to net growth and survival of maintaining a high growth potential at low light, because high growth potential results in greater rates of whole-plant respiration, tissue turnover, herbivory and mechanical damage and in decreased storage. Thus, shade tolerance can be characterized by traits that maximize survival and net growth, where net growth includes losses to all agents.;;;;;4th New Phytologist Symposium on At the Crossroads of Plant Physiology and Ecology, at the Meeting of the ENSA-M;OCT, 1998;;MONTPELLIER, FRANCE;210;7;195;5;223;0028-646X;;WOS:000081916300014;

The five species were: Betula ermanii, Betula platyphylla var. japonica, and Alnus hirsuta (early-successional species with continuous leaf development), Ulmus davidiana var. japonica (mid-successional species with flush and continuous leaf development), and Acer mono (late-successional species with a flush type leaf development). In plants grown in the Mn environment for about 45 d, relative growth rate (RGR) decreased with increasing Mn supply. Between the 1 and 100 g(Mn) m(-3), RGR decreased by 20 % for B. ermanii and B. platyphylla, by 40 % for A. hirsuta and A. mono, and by 80 % for U. davidiana. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) of all species were little affected by high Mn supply. In U. davidiana, however, there was a 67 % decrease in LMR in Mn-100 plants. Leaf area ratio (LAR) was higher in early-successional species than in mid- and late-successional ones but differed little among Mn treatments within species, except for U. davidiana where LAR declined substantially with increased Mn supply. While LAR, which represents the relative size of assimilatory apparatus, was little affected, net photosynthetic rate (P-N) saturated with radiant energy decreased with increasing Mn supply in all species. Thus P-N was adversely affected by high accumulation of Mn in leaves, which resulted in an overall reduction in biomass production. However, the proportional allocation of photosynthates to the assimilatory apparatus was not affected by different Mn toxicity in hardwood tree seedlings.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0300-3604;;WOS:000081707500004;

H and RI were independent. All allometric relationships between H and the parameters of plant biomass and dimensions were positively affected by RI, signifying that at a common H, saplings increased horizontal growth relative to vertical growth in environments with greater irradiance. Root mass ratio (coarse plus fine roots per total plant biomass) increased with increasing irradiance in both species and was not different between the species. However, Q. robur had a larger stem mass ratio, while A. platanoides had a greater leaf mass ratio (LMR). At a common irradiance, leaf mass per area (LMA) was lower in A. platanoides. As a result of these interspecific differences in fractional allocation of sapling biomass in foliage and biomass requirement for construction of foliar surface area, leaf area ratio (LAR = LMR/LMA) was larger in A. platanoides. Relative growth rate of standing biomass (RGR) was significantly correlated with RI in both species and was not different between the species. In contrast, net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR) was larger in Q. robur. Thus, in these species a similar RGR (NAR X LAR) was achieved in a completely different way: A. platanoides increased the intercepting foliar area, while Q. robur increased the productivity per unit area. Growth analysis repeated on a nitrogen basis demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency (biomass increment per unit nitrogen) was similar between the species, and that the species differences in NAR resulted from different foliar N concentrations; fractional nitrogen investment in foliage was independent of species. but lower nitrogen cost of leaves allowed A. platanoides to construct a more extensive foliar display with the same nitrogen investment in foliage. Biomass allocation between different compartments was also dependent on sapling size. With increasing H, A. platanoides maintained a constant proportion of biomass in foliage, but the relative amount of foliage decreased in Q. robur. Therefore, due to a decreasing investment of resources in foliage construction with advancing sapling ontogeny, saplings of similar height require more light to survive in Q. robur than in A. platanoides. Greater investment of biomass in leaves vs. standing biomass may result in lower volume pain and reduced competitive ability in more open habitats in A. platanoides. These results indicate that interspecific differences in allometry and nitrogen allocation patterns significantly alter species competitive relations during sapling development across the gap-understory continuum.";;;;;;;;;40;2;38;0;42;1058-5893;;WOS:000072789100018;

Irradiance influences growth directly through differences in carbon gain, and indirectly through differences in carbon partitioning. In this paper we present an analysis of the morphological and physiological factors influencing the growth rates of tropical tree seedlings with different ecological strategies.A compilation was made of published data on relative growth rates and biomass allocation of species in contrasting light environments. The compilation encompasses 43 studies and 194 species. All morphological characteristics show ontogenetic trends. Stem mass ratio (SMR) increases with plant mass, mainly at the expense of the leaf mass ratio (LMR). A concomitant decrease in specific leaf area (SLA) leads to reduced leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and hence, a lower relative growth rate (RGR) when plants increase in size. Pioneers grow faster than shade-tolerant species, not only in high light but also in low-light conditions. In low light LAR explains interspecific differences in RGR, whereas in high light differences in net assimilation rate (NAR) are more important.We then use these data and additional information on physiological processes to model carbon balances for the average pioneer and shade-tolerant species in both a low- and a high-light environment. Simulated photosynthetic carbon gain is higher in pioneers than in shade-tolerant species, in both light environments. This is due to a larger leaf area in low light, acid the combination of a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rates in high light. Patterns in biomass fractions and carbon partitioning are strikingly different. More than half of the assimilates are partitioned to the leaves (for respiration, the replacement of shed leaves and additional growth), a third is partitioned to the roots and only 15% to the stem. Stems are not a great burden on the carbon balance, due to their low respiration rates and long lifespan. At the whole plant level, respiration consumes the largest share of assimilates, followed by net growth. About 15% of the assimilates are invested in the replacement of shed plant parts.The ability of shade-tolerant species to tolerate shade, apparently reduces the maximal possible growth rate in high light. In contrast, specialization for growth in a high-light environment does not preclude reasonable growth in low light, but probably at the cost of an increased risk of mortality.;;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;105;0;99;1;107;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300019;

To this aim we use a large database with innate seedling mean relative growth rates (RGR) for 97 European woody species. Before we considered it legitimate to scale up from the species level, we first addressed some potential pitfalls due to plant analysis and RGR definition. Subsequently we evaluated the roles of seed reserves and ontogeny/allometry; the possible risks of extrapolation to other (natural) environments; and the role of intraspecific variation in innate mean RGR. None of these factors appeared to affect the broad RGR ranking of the species seriously. Close correlates of seedling mean RGR among woody species were leaf area ratio (LAR) as well as both LAR components, specific leaf area and leaf mass ratio. We then scaled up to larger species assemblages, focusing first on higher taxa and functional types. Higher taxa, life-form, leaf habit, xylem type, life strategy and successional status could each explain part of the interspecific variation in mean RGR. In many cases the contributions of individual factors could be teased out by holding other factors constant, or using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Some of the consistent findings were as follows: woody species belonging to more advanced dicot families grew innately faster than more primitive ones; angiosperm trees faster than gymnosperm trees; deciduous species faster than evergreens; woody climbers and scramblers faster than self-supporting life-forms; shrubs and subshrubs faster than trees; trees with bud-break early in spring and indeterminate shoot growth faster than trees with delayed phenology and determinate shoot growth. This was to some extent correlated with the xylem Vessel size distribution. Trees with ruderal features grew innately faster than more competitive trees, followed by relatively stress-tolerant trees. Pioneer trees tended to grow innately faster than late-successional ones. Then, we tentatively scaled up from innate seedling mean RGR to ecosystem properties. Mediated by nutrient conservation through leaf longevity and anti-herbivore defences, (often evergreen) slow-growing species were found to produce more persistent litter than (often deciduous) fast-growing ones. This could have implications for nutrient turn-over rates in ecosystems. Finally, the woody flora from western Europe's cool-temperate climate belt grew inherently faster than that from a woody flora in the Mediterranean belt, and perhaps faster than that from the Boreal belt.";;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;53;0;51;0;55;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300020;

Low light and, nitrogen effects on hardwood seedlings;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;77;3;;;841;853;;10.2307/2265505;;;APR 1996;1996;Variation in shade tolerance is a primary mechanism driving succession in northern deciduous forests. However, little is known about interspecific differences in the traits responsible for shade tolerance. Is shade tolerance due to the ability to grow or survive in deep shade, or both? How do plant morphology and photosynthesis relate to growth in shade? Is low light the sole critical stress determining differences in ''shade tolerance'' or do belowground resources interact with low light to affect growth and survival? In this study we address these questions for seedlings of Betula papyrifera Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch, Acer saccharum Marsh., and Quercus rubra L. grown for 2 yr in outdoor shade houses in a complete factorial of low light (2 and 8% open sky) and nitrogen (forest soil and forest soil plus 200 kg N . ha(-1) . yr(-1)). For these seedlings we examined effects of light and nitrogen on the interrelationships among survival, growth, and shade tolerance and explored the physiological bases of shade tolerance by examining the relationship of plant morphology and photosynthesis to growth.Nitrogen amendments did not have a significant effect on any plant trait at either light level. In 8% light, growth and survival were highest for shade-intolerant Betula papyrifera and mid-tolerant Betula alleghaniensis, lower for shade-tolerant Ostrya and Acer, and lowest for disturbance-adapted Quercus. In 2% light, species rankings reversed as Ostrya and Acer had higher growth and survival than the other species. Second-year survival was strongly related to 1 st-yr growth (P < 0.001), whereas relationships with 1 st-yr plant mass and 1 st-yr absolute growth rates were weak. Therefore, survival of shade-tolerant species at 2% light was related to their maintenance of positive growth, whereas intolerant species had growth near zero and high rates of mortality. In both 2 and 8% light photosynthetic rates on mass (but not area) bases and the proportion of the plant in leaves (leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio) were positively related to growth. Greater rates of growth and survival for shade-tolerant species in very low light, and for intolerant species in higher light, suggest that there is a species-based trade-off between maximizing growth in high light and minimizing the light compensation point for growth. This trade off may be an important mechanism driving forest community dynamics in northern hardwood forests.;;;;;;;;;223;7;211;2;239;d_c-58;;WOS:A1996UC98500019;

Functional groups of species may differ in any of these traits, potentially resulting in (1) differences in mean RGR of groups, and (2) differences in the traits driving RGR variation within each group. We tested these predictions by comparing deciduous and evergreen savanna trees.Methods RGR, changes to biomass allocation and leaf morphology, and root non-structural carbohydrate reserves were evaluated for juveniles of 51 savanna species (34 deciduous, 17 evergreen) grown in a common garden experiment. It was anticipated that drivers of RGR would differ between leaf habit groups because deciduous species have to allocate carbohydrates to storage in roots to be able to flush leaves again, which directly compromises their LMF, whereas evergreen species are not subject to this constraint.Key Results Evergreen species had greater LMF and RGR than deciduous species. Among deciduous species LMF explained 27% of RGR variation (SLA 34% and NAR 29 %), whereas among evergreen species LMF explained between 2 and 17% of RGR variation (SLA 32-35% and NAR 38-62 %). RGR and LMF were (negatively) related to carbohydrate storage only among deciduous species.Conclusions Trade-offs between investment in carbohydrate reserves and growth occurred only among deciduous species, leading to differences in relative contribution made by the underlying components of RGR between the leaf habit groups. The results suggest that differences in drivers of RGR occur among savanna species because these have different selected strategies for coping with fire disturbance in savannas. It is expected that variation in the drivers of RGR will be found in other functional types that respond differently to particular disturbances.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0305-7364;;WOS:000340434200011;24958787

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effect of increased N availability on growth and functional attributes of seedlings of five tree species with different life history characteristics under varying irradiances. The following questions have been addressed: (i) how do the pioneer and non-pioneer species respond in absolute growth and relative growth rate (RGR) to the interaction of light and nitrogen? (ii) how does the interaction between irradiance and nitrogen availability modulate growth attributes (i.e. functional attributes)? (iii) is there any variation in growth responses between leguminous and non-leguminous species along the light and nitrogen gradients?MethodsSeedlings of five tree species (Acacia catechu, Bridelia retusa, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia arjuna) were subjected to twelve combinations of irradiance and N levels. Various growth traits, including height (HT), basal area (BA), whole plant dry biomass (M-D), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net assimilation rate (NAR), RGR, biomass fractions, root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) and leaf nitrogen content, were studied to analyse intra-and inter-specific responses to interacting light and N gradients.Important FindingsSignificant interactions for irradiance and N availability for majority of growth attributes indicates that growth and biomass allocation of seedlings were more responsive to N availability under high irradiance. However, species responded differentially to N addition and they did not follow successional status. Slow growers (B. retusa, a shade-tolerant species and L. parviflora, a light demander) exhibited greater response to N enrichment than the fast growers (A. catechu, D. sissoo and T. arjuna). However, N-mediated increment in growth traits was greater in non-legumes (B. retusa, L. parviflora and T. arjuna) compared with that of legumes (A. catechu and D. sissoo). Allocation of biomass to root was strongly suppressed at the highest N supply across species; however, at high irradiance and high N availability, a greater suppression in R: S ratio was observed for B. retusa. NAR was a stronger determinant of RGR relative to LAR, suggesting its prominent role in increased RGR along increasing irradiances. Overall, a higher growth response of slow-growing species to elevated N levels, particularly the non-pioneers (B. retusa and L. parviflora) suggests that future N deposition may lead to perturbations in competition hierarchies and species composition, ultimately affecting community dynamics in nutrient-poor tropical dry forests.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1752-9921;;WOS:000337063500005;

In these forests, the natural light and soil moisture conditions are being altered by different human activities, as river channelization and regulation. These new environmental conditions may favor invasive species to the detriment of natives. In order to predict potential shifts of species composition in inner Spain riparian forests, we experimentally compared seedling and sapling performance across the four invasive and the three native mentioned species. Seeds were sown along an experimental gradient with four levels of light (100, 65, 35, 7 % of full irradiance) factorially combined with two levels of soil moisture (61 and 40 % of soil gravimetric water content). We compared plant biomass at the end of the first and second growing seasons, relative growth rates, biomass allocation to roots (RWR), stems (SWR) and leaves (LWR), time to emergence (T-emerg) and net assimilation rate per unit of leaf mass (NAR(m)) between origins and across species. Biomass accumulation greatly varied across species. However, invaders did not grow on average more than natives. Under high resource conditions, all species tended to grow more and similarly. Only the native U. minor and the invader A. negundo were not hampered by low moisture and/or low light availabilities. The absence of superiority of invaders over natives suggests that the former will not displace the latter in inner Spain riparian forests. However, human activities promoting shade and drought stress in floodplains may benefit the invasive A. negundo in the long term, as the growth of its seedlings is less declined by these conditions than the growth of the rest of the studied species. Thus, management effort should be focused in monitoring and preventing this species spread.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1387-3547;;WOS:000330618700003;

We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N(area) in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10% x nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N(area) is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N(area) of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums.

We examined to what extent leaf life span is related to inter- and intraspecific variation in seedling relative growth rate (RGR). We examined relationships between relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) and leaf life span, together with classical RGR(M) components [net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and leaf area ratio (LAR)] for seedlings of five hardwood species of different successional position across a wide range of environmental resource availability, including the presence or absence of leaf litter in shaded forest understory, small canopy gaps, and large canopy gaps. Both SLA and LAR were negatively correlated with RGR(M) along the environmental gradient for all species. However, positive correlations were observed among species within microsites, indicating that these two components cannot consistently explain the variation in RGR(M). Both NAR and LWR affect interspecific, but not intraspecific, variation in RGR(M). Leaf life span was negatively correlated with either RGR(M) or RGR(H) in both inter- and intraspecific comparisons. Species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth rates, particularly in resource-rich environments. Consequently, leaf life span is a good predictor of seedling RGR.

The ornamental plant trade, forestry, and agriculture have been responsible for the initial introduction of over 60% of invasive alien plant species. Screening tools to test potentially new horticultural species should help curtail the continued introduction of new invaders.2. Using two methods for analysing phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of known invasive and non-invasive, exotic woody horticultural species, we tested the potential of relative growth rate (RGR) and related traits including net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), and specific leaf area (SLA) as predictors of invasiveness. These 29 PICs include 65 species and broadly cover angiosperms.3. Without accounting for phylogeny, no significant differences were found in seedling RGR or related traits between invasive and non-invasive woody species. Using PICs, invasive species' RGRs were significantly higher. RGR was considerably more significant using our extensive dataset than in previous smaller studies, while SLA and LAR remained marginally significant. NAR was significantly higher for invasives for the 10-20 days interval.4. Analysis of this broad data set confirms that RGR is significantly higher for invasive woody species than their non-invasive counterparts, and may serve as a useful biological predictor of invasiveness for woody angiosperms. This expanded study shows that plant species use different physiological and biomass allocation patterns to achieve higher RGR; therefore individual components of RGR, such as SLA, do not consistently predict potential invasiveness of species.5. Synthesis and applications. Comparative seedling RGR studies show that this measure has potential as a screening tool for new exotic plant species. Unfortunately, more easily measurable components of RGR do not consistently predict invasiveness, as previously thought. Using seedling RGR analysis as an invasive species' screening tool requires growing a species proposed for introduction with related invasive and non-invasive species. If the tested species' RGR is higher or not significantly different from its known invasive counterpart, it should be considered highly likely to become invasive, and excluded from further consideration as a potential horticultural species. Seedling RGR could potentially produce a useful, straightforward screening tool when phylogenetically related species or cultivars are available.";;;;;;;;;12;0;12;1;13;0021-8901;;WOS:000283983200019;

Root mass ratio had a strong negative relationship with LMR, and proportion of fine-root biomass per total root biomass was positively correlated with SLA and NAR. Both NAR and leaf area ratio were important determinants of variation in relative growth rate (RGR). Leaf mass ratio (LMR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with RGR; the correlation was stronger in the case of LMR. Along a water-table gradient, negative relationships between root growth responses are likely to indirectly influence RGR through changes in NAR, LMR, and SLA.";;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0931-1890;;WOS:000284153700017;

Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR). The mean values of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P (nmax)) in 25 and 5% daylight were 12.8 and 8.0 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for G. integrifolia and 17.9 and 7.4 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for S. terebinthifolius. Based on the measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density and estimated values of photosynthetic saturated irradiance (Is) we concluded that, in all shaded conditions, the leaves of both species were under sub optimal light conditions to reach P (nmax). In spite of the lowest P (nmax) values, RGR and NAR were significantly higher for G. integrifolia in all irradiance levels. Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.;;;;;;;;;5;1;2;2;7;0167-4366;;WOS:000268865600005;

We predicted that Q. pyrenaica would behave more as a stress-tolerant species, with lower specific leaf area (SLA), allocation to leaf mass, and growth rate and less responsiveness to light in these metrics, than Q. petraea, presumed to be more competitive when resources, especially light and water, are abundant. Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL. They also displayed a higher proportion of biomass in stems (SMF), and a lower root to shoot ratio (R/S) in HL than those of Q. pyrenaica, which sprouted profusely, and had higher rates of photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(wv)), but lower whole-plant net assimilation rate (NAR).

We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.";;;;;;;;;26;1;24;1;27;1445-4408;;WOS:000259306500007;

Plants encounter a variety of light and nutrient availabilities during succession. However, there is an ongoing debate to which extent light-dependent structural and physiological plasticity is associated with species shade tolerance.2. Seedlings of five species, Betula pubescens Ehrh., B. pendula Roth, Populus tremula L., Quercus robur L. and Acer platanoides L. (from most intolerant to most shade-tolerant), were grown at four different light and nutrient availabilities to test the hypotheses that intolerant species have higher physiological and tolerant species higher structural plasticity to light and also that there is an overall increase in plasticity with increasing nutrient availability. Two replicate experiments in different years were conducted. Plasticity was characterized by four estimates: (1) the range of variation of the components of relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) (RGR = LAR.NAR) at common RGR; (2) average standardized slopes of physiological (RGR, NAR, i.e. physiological plasticity, Pi(P)) and structural (LAR, leaf dry mass per unit area, biomass allocation traits, i.e. structural plasticity, Pi(S)) traits vs. irradiance relationships; (3) standardized difference of plant traits measured at low to medium irradiance; (4) coefficient of variation across different irradiance treatments.3. Plant growth was more strongly associated with NAR than with structural traits, but shade-intolerant species had a greater range of variation in both NAR and LAR at a common RGR. RGR, NAR and structural characteristics also responded more strongly to increases in irradiance in shade-intolerant species, but at low irradiance RGR and NAR were similar among all species. Owing to higher biomass fraction in leaves, the intolerant species produced less woody biomass. In nonfertilized plants, both Pi(P) and Pi(S) were negatively associated with shade tolerance. The plasticity was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the nutrient-dependent enhancement in plasticity was greater in more tolerant species. Therefore, differences in plasticity among species of varying tolerance were lower at higher nutrient availability.4. Our study does not support the hypothesis of a trade-off between structural and physiological plasticity. Shade-tolerant species are generally less plastic than intolerant species, but increases in nutrient availability during succession reduce the differences in plasticity. Despite similar RGR in low light, first-year seedlings of shade-tolerant species produce more woody biomass, favouring survival and growth in subsequent years.";;;;;;;;;54;12;46;3;68;0269-8463;;WOS:000243412200007;

Cecropia seedlings showed greater trait plasticity at the 2-15% light interval, whereas Cedrela seedlings showed a slight tendency to present greater trait plasticity at the 15-30% light interval than the 2-15% interval.

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-301% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0266-4674;;WOS:000242132900005;

Compared to CO2, light and water treatment had greater effects on all morphological traits measured (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, biomass fractions). Cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO2 under low-watered (W-) and high-illuminated conditions (L+). Allocation shifted from shoot to root under increasing irradiance (L+), but was not affected by CO2. Changes in allocation related to water limitation were only modest, and changed over time. Relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were significantly greatest in the L+/W+ treatment for both CO2 concentrations. Changes in RGR were mainly due to NAR. Growth responses to increased light, water or CO2 were strongest with light, medium with water availability and smallest for CO2, in terms of RGR. The rise in NAR for light and water treatments was counterbalanced by a decrease in SLA (specific leaf area) and LMF (leaf mass fraction). Results suggest that elevated CO2 caused cork oak seedlings to improve their performance in dry and high light environments to a greater extent than in well-irrigated and low light ones, thus ameliorating the effects of soil water stress and high light loads on growth.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0931-1890;;WOS:000242296600006;

We tested for significant interactive effects of light and nutrient availabilities on foliage architecture, chemistry, biomass allocation and growth in shade intolerant temperate deciduous trees Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh. First-year seedlings were grown at four irradiance and four N and P availability combinations, and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. In both species, increases in light availability resulted in larger net assimilation rate (NAR, total plant biomass production rate per unit leaf area), root mass fraction (F-R) and leaf mass per unit area M-A but reductions in leaf area ratio (LAR, foliage area per total plant dry mass), stem mass fraction (F-S) and leaf mass fraction (F-L). The strong decrease in LAR (LAR = F-L/M-A) With light mainly resulted from increases in MA. The light-dependent increase in NAR was larger than the decline in LAR such that plant relative growth rate (RGR = NAR x LAR) scaled positively with light in both species. Nutrient availability mainly enhanced LAR, and moderately NAR, further improving RGR. The increase in LAR was primarily associated with increases in F-L and decreases in FR. Significant interactions between light and nutrients were found for most of the studied variables, overall indicating that plant allocation and growth were more responsive to nutrients at higher light availability. Several significant species and year-to-year differences were observed among the allocation and growth characteristics that were driven by plant size, climate and seedling source. Greater RGR of B. pubescens that is a species colonizing habitats with lower nutrient availability was linked to its greater foliage nitrogen concentrations. Overall, the study highlights a significant light x nutrient interaction that can modify seedling performance along natural gap-understory gradients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

Dry mass weighted average nitrogen (N-W) and phosphorus (P-W) contents were higher in P. sylvestris in sand dunes than in those in the raised bog, but P-W/N-W ratios overlapped between the sites. Leaf dry mass ratio (F-L) and leaf-area ratio (LAR) increased with N-W, and F-L increased with P-W. The relative growth rate (R-G) was more strongly associated with P-W than with N-W. The net assimilation rate per leaf dry mass (NAR(M)) scaled positively with P-W but not with N-W, demonstrating that the stronger effect of P-W on growth was due to modified biomass allocation and physiology (R-G = NAR(M) x F-L), while N-W affected growth via biomass allocation. Partitioning and growth characteristics were poorly related to the P-W/N-W ratio. The overall decrease of growth in larger trees resulted from their lower LAR and F-L. Increases in size further led to a lower N-W but higher P-W. We conclude that optimum productivity at a given N-W requires a certain minimum P-W, not a specific ""non-limiting"" P-W/N-W ratio.

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;21;1435-8603;;WOS:000232416400006;16163613

Seedlings were grown outdoors during summer under two irrigation treatments: field capacity and 35% of field capacity. The relative growth rate (RGR) strongly depended on the growth form, from highest values in herbs to lowest in woody perennials. The main component associated with interspecific variation in RGR was the specific leaf area (SLA), and a quantitative grouping of the different growth forms appeared along the regression line between both parameters. The slow-growing species, i.e. woody perennial shrubs, had the lowest SLA and the fast-growing perennial herbs, the highest, while woody semi-deciduous shrubs appeared intermediate. Decreases in RGR due to water stress were analysed in terms of the relative contribution of the leaf mass ratio (LMR), SLA and the net assimilation rate (NAR). Pooling all species, the decrease in RGR caused by water deficit was mainly explained by decreases in SLA. However, this general pattern was strongly dependent of growth form. Thus, in the woody perennial plants, the decrease in RGR was accompanied by a three-fold decrease in NAR which, however, increased in perennial herbs. SLA increased with decreasing water supply in woody perennial plants, and decreased in woody semi-deciduous shrubs and perennial herbs. Finally, decreases in LMR partly explained decreases in RGR in perennial herbs and woody perennial shrubs. This different response of the different growth forms may reflect differences in seedling adaptation and surviving strategies to drought periods.;;;;;;;;;32;1;30;0;34;0029-8549;;WOS:000231779500003;15868165

This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.;;;;;;;;;42;6;41;3;49;0029-8549;;WOS:000226357400005;15503163

Seedlings in the wet treatment were watered once every 2 or 3 days, whereas seedlings in the dry treatment were watered when soil water content (theta; m(3) m(-3)) reached 0.30, equivalent to a soil matric potential of -0.06 MPa. From Weeks 7 to 12 after the onset of the treatments, seedling transpiration was measured by weighing the potted seedlings. After the last watering, changes in transpiration rate during soil drying were monitored intensely. The dry treatment restricted aboveground growth but increased biomass allocation to the roots in both species, resulting in no significant treatment difference in whole-plant biomass production. The species showed similar responses in relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and shoot mass ratio (SMR) to the dry treatment. Although NAR did not change significantly in either C. japonica or C. obtusa as the soil dried, the two species responded differently to the dry treatment in terms of mean transpiration rate (E) and water-use efficiency (WUE), which are parameters that relate to NAR. In the dry treatment, both E and WUE of C. japonica were stable, whereas in C. obtusa, E decreased and WUE increased (E and WUE counterbalanced to maintain a constant NAR). Transpiration rates were lower in C. obtusa seedlings than in C. japonica seedlings, even in well-watered conditions. During soil drying, the transpiration rate decreased after 0 reached about 0.38 (-0.003 MPa) in C. obtusa and 0.32 (-0.028 MPa) in C. japonica.

At low and high salinities, the VLO/SAO/CM combination had higher mean RGR than VLO/CM. Under control conditions, the increase in RGR caused by the interstock was the result of an increase in leaf mass fraction (LMF; leaf dry mass/plant dry mass ratio). Increases in net assimilation rate on a leaf mass basis (NAR(m)) and LMF contributed equally to the increase in RGR in saline conditions, their growth response coefficients being 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. The structural modifications, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR; leaf area: plant dry mass ratio), had a slight influence on the reduction in RGR by salinity. However, NAR(m) had a large influence on RGR, except in CM. The interstock-induced mechanism increased biomass allocation to the assimilatory organs and, under saline conditions, increased Cl- and Na+ allocations to roots. Thus, the flux of ions to the leaves was either delayed or reduced or both. The dilution of imported ions by foliar growth reduced ion concentrations in leaves, resulting in higher NAR(m), which together with higher LMF, increased RGR.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0829-318X;;WOS:000224449200004;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Germination tests were conducted under five osmotic potential levels. Seedlings from large (LS) and small (SS) seeds were grown at four soil moisture levels. Observations were made on height, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits such as relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Seeds of pioneer species and large seeds, within species, germinated earlier, and with increasing water stress, per cent germination and germination velocity declined. RGR was inversely related with drought tolerance. R:S ratio increased, RGR and SLA declined, but NAR increased with water stress. Notwithstanding successional status, the slow-growing species registered minimum reduction in biomass due to water stress. The response of LS and SS seedlings also differed for some of the growth variables. Increase in NAR could be a compensatory response to water stress, and the marked allocational plasticity could help maximize capture of the limited resource. Seedlings from smaller seeds, particularly of fast-growing species, would be able to cope with mild drought by morphogenetic and physiological plastic response in a better way than those from large seeds. However, seedlings from large seeds had greater survival than those from smaller seeds under intense water stress.;;;;;;;;;28;1;28;0;30;0266-4674;;WOS:000222985200004;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Seedlings from large (LS) and small seeds ( SS) were grown at two CO2 levels ( ambient and elevated, 700 - 750 ppm). CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and foliar N were determined after 30 d exposure to elevated CO2. Seedlings were harvested after 30 d and 60 d exposure periods. Height, diameter, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits (RGR, NAR, SLA, R: S) were determined. Seedling biomass across species was positively related with seed mass. Within species, LS seedlings exhibited greater biomass than SS seedlings. Elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass for all the species. The relative growth rate ( RGR), net assimilation rate ( NAR), CO2 assimilation rate, R: S ratio and water use efficiency increased under elevated CO2. However, the positive impact of elevated CO2 was down regulated beyond 30 d exposure. Specific leaf area ( SLA), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance declined due to exposure to elevated CO2. Fast growing, early successional species exhibited greater RGR, NAR and CO2 assimilation rate. Per cent enhancement in such traits was greater for slow growing species. The responses of individual species did not follow functional types (viz. legumes, non-legumes). The enhancement in biomass and RGR was greater for large-seeded species and LS seedlings within species.

I compared photosynthetic physiology, growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of three shade-tolerant tree species, Virola koschynii Warb., Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record & Mell and Brosimum alicastrum Swartz., growing across a light gradient created by a forest-pasture edge (0.5 to 67% diffuse transmittance (%T)). Most growth and physiological traits showed nonlinear responses to light availability, with the greatest changes occurring between 0.5 and 20 %T. Specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen per unit leaf mass (N(mass)) decreased, maximum assimilation per unit leaf area (A(area)) and area-based leaf N concentration (N(area)) increased, and maximum assimilation per unit leaf mass (A(mass)) did not change with increasing irradiance. Plastic responses in SLA were important determinants of leaf N and A a across the gradient. Species differed in magnitude and plasticity of growth; B. alicastrum had the lowest relative growth rates (RGR) and low plasticity. Its final biomass varied only 10-fold across the light gradient. In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.";;;;;;;;;34;0;34;1;35;0829-318X;;WOS:000188786300003;14676032

A key factor in the growth response of trees to elevated [CO2] is the availability of nitrogen, although how elevated [CO2] influences the rate of N-2-fixation of nodulated trees growing under field conditions is unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we measured total biomass, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area and net photosynthetic rate of N-2-fixing Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (common alder) trees grown for 3 years in open-top chambers in the presence of either ambient or elevated atmospheric [CO2] and two soil N regimes: full nutrient solution or no fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation by Frankia spp. in the root nodules of unfertilized trees was assessed by the acetylene reduction method. We hypothesized that unfertilized trees would show similar positive growth and physiological responses to elevated [CO2] as the fertilized trees.Growth in elevated [CO2] stimulated (relative) net photosynthesis and (absolute) total biomass accumulation. Relative total biomass increased, and leaf nitrogen remained stable, only during the first year of the experiment. Toward the end of the experiment, signs of photosynthetic acclimation occurred, i.e., down-regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Relative growth rate was not significantly affected by elevated [CO2] because although NAR was increased, the effect on relative growth rate was negated by a reduction in leaf area ratio. Neither leaf area nor leaf P concentration was affected by growth in elevated [CO2].Nodule mass increased on roots of unfertilized trees exposed to elevated [CO2] compared with fertilized trees exposed to ambient [CO2]. There was also a biologically significant, although not statistically significant, stimulation of nitrogenase activity in nodules exposed to elevated [CO2]. Root nodules of trees exposed to elevated [CO2] were smaller and more evenly spaced than root nodules of trees exposed and [CO2] effects on growth, biomass and photosynthesis indicates that the unfertilized trees maintained similar CO2-induced growth and photosynthetic enhancements as the fertilized trees. This implies that alder trees growing in natural conditions, which are often limited by soil N availability, should nevertheless benefit from increasing atmospheric [CO2].;;;;;;;;;19;0;18;0;20;0829-318X;;WOS:000186057000005;12975129

An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs.

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg.

Three separate experiments were conducted, involving 27 herbaceous species and 14 woody species aged 15-30 days, in order to determine the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in explaining interspecific variations in relative growth rate.2. Daily quantum inputs were 31.12 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the first experiment and 33.17 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the second and third experiments. This is about twice the typical irradiance of most other experiments in this area, but only about 85% of the daily photon flux in nature. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic sand culture in a solution containing 5.8 mm nitrogen.3. RGR was strongly and positively correlated with NAR in all three experiments. RGR was weakly and negatively correlated with SLA, while the correlation between RGR and LWR was weak and variable.4. These results are compared to those already published in the literature: the commonly reported result that interspecific variation in RGR is determined primarily by SLA is partly due to the low irradiance used in most experiments, and the relative importance of SLA and NAR changes depending on irradiance.5. A hypothesis is proposed in which direct and indirect effects of SLA on each of NAR and RGR are decomposed, and which leads to a trade-off between SLA and NAR as a function of daily irradiance.;;;;;;;;;84;9;81;1;97;0269-8463;;WOS:000178119300016;

Fraxinus velutina had both the highest net assimilation rate (NAR) and relative growth rate (RGR) regardless of irrigation treatment. Mean specific leaf weight (dry weight (DW) of a 1-cm(2) leaf disc divided by the weight), trichome density, stomatal density, leaf thickness, and cuticular wax content varied among species but not between irrigation treatments. Leaves of Q. buckleyi Buckl. (Texas red oak) had one of the highest stomatal densities, and also had leaves which were among the waxiest, most dense, and thickest. Abaxial leaf surfaces of F. velutina were the most pubescent. Across species, drought led to lower ratios of leaf surface area to root DW, and leaf DW to root DW. Quercus buckleyi plants subjected to drought had the highest root to shoot DW ratio (3.1). The low relative growth rate of Q. buckleyi might limit widespread landscape use. However, Q. buckleyi may merit increased use in landscapes on a reduced moisture budget because of foliar traits, carbon allocation patterns, ana the relative lack of impact of drought on plant tissue water relations.;;;;;;;;;13;0;14;0;17;0003-1062;;WOS:000173901200011;

Saplings were grown under different conditions in two chambers: (1) a temperature gradient chamber at ambient temperature, 3 and 5 degreesC warmer condition's with an ambient CO2 concentration, and (2) in a CO2 temperature gradient chamber at 3 degreesC warmer conditions,with 1.5 times the normal CO2 concentration, and 5 degreesC warmer conditions with doubled CO2 concentration. The 3 and 5 degreesC warmer conditions enhanced the relative growth rate during almost the entire year, producing 53 and 47% increases in annual biomass production, 27 and 44% enhancement of root growth during shoot dormancy and 3 and 5 week prolongation of the shoot growing period, respectively. However, a daily mean air temperature exceeding 30 degreesC under the 5 degreesC warmer condition caused a marked reduction in net assimilation rate (NAR) from July to September. The CO2 enrichment further enhanced the positive effects of warming in spring and the resulting increases in NAR almost completely compensated for the negative effect of warming during summer. From autumn to winter, attenuation of the effects of CO2 was compensated by the increased sink strength produced by the warming. The annual biomass production was more than doubled by the combination of temperature elevation and CO2 enrichment.;;;;;;;;;16;9;18;0;26;0140-7791;;WOS:000171286900001;

In contrast to studies with herbaceous species at lower light, net assimilation rate (NAR) contributed more than leaf area ratio (LAR) or specific leaf area (SLA) to interspecific variation in RGR. This was associated with a larger interspecific variation in NAR than found in experiments with lower light. Without the two most shade-tolerant species, however, the contribution of LAR and its components to interspecific variation in RGR was similar or even higher than that of NAR. Leaf dry matter content correlated negatively with RGR and was the only component of LAR contributing in a similar manner to variation in LAIR and RGR. There was a positive correlation between NAR and biomass allocation to roots, which may be a result of nutrient-limited growth. RGR correlated negatively with biomass allocation to leaves. Leaf thickness did not correlate with RGR, as the positive effect of thin leaves was counterbalanced by their lower NAR. Low inherent RGR was associated with species from nutrient-poor or shady habitats. Different components constrained growth for these two groups of species, those from nutrient-poor habitats having high leaf dry matter content, while those from shady habitats had thin leaves with low NAR.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;1435-8603;;WOS:000170738300017;

The growth response of seedlings of A. procera from seeds of different sizes was studied under four soil water levels. Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated and grown in a glasshouse for 3 weeks under optimal water supply, and were subsequently maintained at four soil water levels for 4 months. Soil matric potentials for 1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 water holding capacity (WHC) were -0.01, -0.1, -0.61 and -1.20 MPa. respectively. Plant height, stem diameter and leaf area were measured fortnightly. Seedlings were harvested at the end of the experiment. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), stem weight ratio (SWR), root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were determined. Seedlings from large seeds had a higher biomass and leaf area and were more tolerant of long-term extreme water stress compared to those from small seeds which were more tolerant of moderate levels of water stress. Seedlings from small seeds did not survive beyond 75 d at 1/4 WHC. Increase in the R:S ratio along with a decrease in SWR reflected a shift in biomass allocation from above- to below-ground parts as soil water level decreased. SLA declined sharply with increasing water stress, which in turn led to a decrease in RGR. NAR increased with water stress. The study revealed the ability of the species to acclimate to a wide range of moisture stress by morphogenetic (increased R:S ratio and decreased SWR) and physiological (increased NAR) plastic responses.

The seedlings were grown in closed-top chambers at four temperature regimes (-2.9 degrees C below ambient, ambient, + 2.3 degrees C and + 4.8 degrees C above ambient) in combination with two CO2 partial pressures (40 Pa and 74 Pa). Growth was followed by making destructive harvests c. every 25 d from germination in early June to senescence in late September. Allocation patterns were significantly affected by the temperature regimes. However, changes in dry matter allocation and morphology associated with the different treatments at a given time were mostly a result of differences in tree size. Temperature regimes only had a significant effect on the relative growth rate, RGR, at the beginning of the experiment. In contrast to temperature, high [CO2] increased RGR throughout the experiment when compared with plants of equal size. As the trees increased in size net assimilation rate, NAR, decreased but the effect of [CO2] on both NAR and RGR had a tendency to increase. Increases in NAR caused by elevated [CO2] were partly counteracted by reductions in the leaf area ratio, NAR. Reductions in LAR were caused by concomitant reductions in specific leaf area, SLA, whereas the level of [CO2] did not significantly affect leaf weight ratio, LWR, nor other dry weight ratios. The interactions between temperature and [CO2] are highly dependent on whether they are expressed as instantaneous values for plants at a common age or instantaneous values at a common size (and thereby extracting the effects of ontogenetic drift). When comparing instantaneous values at common sizes, the positive effect of [CO2] on RGR increased with plant size in every temperature regime. This also occurred in every temperature regime when comparing plants of equal age but the response to [CO2] was less. The effect of [CO2] on RGR was dependent on growth temperature. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on RGR were less than the positive effect on photosynthesis. The two provenances did not differ significantly in the response of RGR to [CO2] which is in agreement with measurements of photosynthesis.;;;;;;;;;26;0;24;0;26;0028-646X;;WOS:000088299900007;

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, SLA), net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, NARa) and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, LMR). Commonly, most cross-species variation in RGR is accounted for by variation in SLA, while no general relationships occur between RGR and either NARa or LMR. NARa can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, LNP) and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, LNCa). In this way the influence on RGR of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated.2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in SLA, LNP, LNCa and LMR explained c. 44%, 22%, 19% and 15% of variation in RGR, respectively. SLA and LNP were positively associated with RGR, while LNCa was negatively associated with RGR. LNP and LNCa were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between RGR and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between RGR and NARa. It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between NARa and RGR.3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' (NAR) and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, NUR). At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low RGR tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be co-ordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with RGR across all species.;;;;;;;;;47;21;49;2;71;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500013;

Specifically. we asked whether fast- and slow-growing species systematically differ in their response to elevated CO2. Four slow-growing species from semi-arid environments (Acacia aneura, A. colei, A. coriacea and A. tetragonophylla) and six fast-growing species from mesic environments (Acacia dealbata, A. implexa, A. mearnsii, A. melanoxylon, A. irrorata and A. saligna) were grown in glasshouses with either ambient (similar to 350 ppm) or elevated (similar to 700 ppm) atmospheric CO2. All species reached greater final plant mass with the exception of A. aneura, and RGR, averaged across all species, increased by 10% over a 12-week period when plants were exposed to elevated CO2. The stimulation of RGR was evident throughout the 12-week growth period. Elevated CO2 resulted in less foliage area per unit foliage dry mass, which was mainly the result of an increase in foliage thickness with a smaller contribution from greater dry matter content per unit fresh mass. The net assimilation rate (NAR, increase in plant mass per unit foliage area and time) of the plants grown at elevated CO2 was higher in all species (on average 30% higher than plants in ambient CO2) and was responsible for the increase in RGR. The higher NAR was associated with a substantial increase in foliar nitrogen productivity in all ten Acacia species. Plant nitrogen concentration was unaltered by growth at elevated CO2 for the slow-growing Acacia species, but declined by 10% for faster-growing species. The rate of nitrogen uptake per unit root mass was higher in seven of the species when grown under elevated CO2, and leaf area per unit root mass was reduced by elevated CO2 in seven of the species. The absolute increase in RGR due to growth under elevated CO2 was greater for fast- than for slow-growing Acacia species.;;;;;;;;;47;0;41;0;47;0029-8549;;WOS:000082858900010;

Classical growth analysis was applied to both species and mean current relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T) and leaf dry mass (R-L), and period relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T(t)) and leaf dry mass (R-L(t)) were calculated. Sitka spruce saplings and cherry seedlings showed a positive growth response to elevated [CO2], and at the end of the experiments both species were approximate to 40% larger in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. As a result, the period mean R-T(t) and R-L(t) were significantly higher in elevated [CO2]. The differences in plant dry mass at the end of the experiments were a consequence of the more rapid growth in the early phase of exposure to elevated [CO2]. After this initial phase mean R-T and R-L were similar or even lower in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. NAR of both species was much higher in elevated [CO2], whereas both LAR, SLA, and LMR showed the opposite trend. The higher LAR and SLA of plants in ambient [CO2] contributed to a compensation by which they maintained R-T Similar to that of elevated [CO2] saplings despite lower NAR and photosynthetic rate. However, when the same size the trees were similar amongst the [CO2] treatments, indicating that one of the main effect of elevated [CO2] on tree growth is to speed-up early development in all aspects.;;;;;;;;;45;2;38;0;47;1354-1013;;WOS:000081655000001;

The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span.2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light.3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA; SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span.4.

H and RI were independent. All allometric relationships between H and the parameters of plant biomass and dimensions were positively affected by RI, signifying that at a common H, saplings increased horizontal growth relative to vertical growth in environments with greater irradiance. Root mass ratio (coarse plus fine roots per total plant biomass) increased with increasing irradiance in both species and was not different between the species. However, Q. robur had a larger stem mass ratio, while A. platanoides had a greater leaf mass ratio (LMR). At a common irradiance, leaf mass per area (LMA) was lower in A. platanoides. As a result of these interspecific differences in fractional allocation of sapling biomass in foliage and biomass requirement for construction of foliar surface area, leaf area ratio (LAR = LMR/LMA) was larger in A. platanoides. Relative growth rate of standing biomass (RGR) was significantly correlated with RI in both species and was not different between the species. In contrast, net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR) was larger in Q. robur. Thus, in these species a similar RGR (NAR X LAR) was achieved in a completely different way: A. platanoides increased the intercepting foliar area, while Q. robur increased the productivity per unit area. Growth analysis repeated on a nitrogen basis demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency (biomass increment per unit nitrogen) was similar between the species, and that the species differences in NAR resulted from different foliar N concentrations; fractional nitrogen investment in foliage was independent of species. but lower nitrogen cost of leaves allowed A. platanoides to construct a more extensive foliar display with the same nitrogen investment in foliage. Biomass allocation between different compartments was also dependent on sapling size. With increasing H, A. platanoides maintained a constant proportion of biomass in foliage, but the relative amount of foliage decreased in Q. robur. Therefore, due to a decreasing investment of resources in foliage construction with advancing sapling ontogeny, saplings of similar height require more light to survive in Q. robur than in A. platanoides. Greater investment of biomass in leaves vs. standing biomass may result in lower volume pain and reduced competitive ability in more open habitats in A. platanoides. These results indicate that interspecific differences in allometry and nitrogen allocation patterns significantly alter species competitive relations during sapling development across the gap-understory continuum.";;;;;;;;;40;2;38;0;42;1058-5893;;WOS:000072789100018;

Irradiance influences growth directly through differences in carbon gain, and indirectly through differences in carbon partitioning. In this paper we present an analysis of the morphological and physiological factors influencing the growth rates of tropical tree seedlings with different ecological strategies.A compilation was made of published data on relative growth rates and biomass allocation of species in contrasting light environments. The compilation encompasses 43 studies and 194 species. All morphological characteristics show ontogenetic trends. Stem mass ratio (SMR) increases with plant mass, mainly at the expense of the leaf mass ratio (LMR). A concomitant decrease in specific leaf area (SLA) leads to reduced leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and hence, a lower relative growth rate (RGR) when plants increase in size. Pioneers grow faster than shade-tolerant species, not only in high light but also in low-light conditions. In low light LAR explains interspecific differences in RGR, whereas in high light differences in net assimilation rate (NAR) are more important.We then use these data and additional information on physiological processes to model carbon balances for the average pioneer and shade-tolerant species in both a low- and a high-light environment. Simulated photosynthetic carbon gain is higher in pioneers than in shade-tolerant species, in both light environments. This is due to a larger leaf area in low light, acid the combination of a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rates in high light. Patterns in biomass fractions and carbon partitioning are strikingly different. More than half of the assimilates are partitioned to the leaves (for respiration, the replacement of shed leaves and additional growth), a third is partitioned to the roots and only 15% to the stem. Stems are not a great burden on the carbon balance, due to their low respiration rates and long lifespan. At the whole plant level, respiration consumes the largest share of assimilates, followed by net growth. About 15% of the assimilates are invested in the replacement of shed plant parts.The ability of shade-tolerant species to tolerate shade, apparently reduces the maximal possible growth rate in high light. In contrast, specialization for growth in a high-light environment does not preclude reasonable growth in low light, but probably at the cost of an increased risk of mortality.;;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;105;0;99;1;107;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300019;

To test the predicted relationship between growth rate and biomass allocation in relation to nutrient availability, seedlings of 34 woody species from the tropical deciduous forest in Mexico were grown under two contrasting nutrient conditions.2. Dry biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), root/shoot ratio (R/S), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), root weight ratio (RWR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and the nitrogen and carbon leaf percentage were determined following an initial and final harvest. In all the parameters evaluated, the trend followed by the species under low nutrient conditions was similar to the trend attained in high nutrient conditions but with different magnitude.3. The species with the largest seed biomass was Thevetia ovata (3808.6mg). Lagrezia monosperma had the smallest seeds (0.13 mg) and the highest RGR in the high nutrient treatment. However, the relationship between RGR and seed biomass among the 34 species studied was weak (r=-0.50 in low and -0.62 in high nutrients).4. Higher biomass allocation to roots Was shown under low nutrient condition but the relationship between RGR and root/shoot ratio was non-significant.5. Species variation in RGR to both the nutrient treatments employed is followed by species variations in LAR (r=0.50) more than changes in NAR (r=0.20). Changes in LAR are explained by LWR (r=0.62) and SLA (r=0.70). Under low and high nutrients, the RGR was highly correlated with SLA (r=0.67 and 0.60), suggesting the importance of both the total leaf area produced and the leaf morphological characteristics in determining the RGR.6. A general characteristic of the distribution of the species' responses in RGR to both nutrient treatments was the existence of a continuum, for all of the parameters studied. This suggests differences in the species' resource utilization and tolerance, which are reflected in different plastic capacities.;;;;;;;;;73;0;69;3;74;0269-8463;;WOS:A1995TU96300006;

Plants were kept in a shade house for a period of 15 months at 37%, 10% and 2.5% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), roughly corresponding to light environments in large gaps, small gaps, and forest understorey, respectively. The species were chosen to represent a wide array of taxa, ecological, and morphological characteristics, and were assigned regeneration niche (RN) index values based on observations of life history and spatial distribution of their seedlings and saplings in various forest microsites.2 Growth, biomass allocation patterns, leaf anatomy and stomatal responses varied appreciably among species, as well as in response to shading. All species showed reduced growth with decreasing light intensity. Plants grown at 37% and 10% PAR exhibited morphological and physiological responses typical of plants found at forest edges and in large gaps: i.e. low leaf area ratio (LAR), high specific leaf weight (SLW), high root-shoot ratio (RSR), high relative growth rate (RGR), high net assimilation rate (NAR), high leaf conductance, and high chlorophyll a/b ratio. Those grown at 2.5% PAR showed the opposite trends. Comparing species within each light level, NAR and LAR showed positive correlation with RGR, but pooled data for all light levels suggests that the contribution of LAR and NAR to RGR are in opposite directions, depending on light conditions.3 Sensitivity of seedling growth to shading was significantly correlated with mean seed reserve weight of the species: small-seeded species were more affected than large-seeded ones. Relationship between seed reserve weight and species RN index value, though linear, was weak and nonsignificant. RGR was significantly correlated with seed reserve weight at 37% and 10% PAR but not at 2.5% PAR, while LAR showed the opposite trend.4 Plasticity of most parameters examined appeared highest in species that regenerate mostly in large gaps (> 200 m2) and at forest edges, and least in species that regenerate mostly in forest understorey and small gaps (< 50 m2). However, ordination of the study species, using seed size and various shade tolerance criteria for the seedlings, yielded a continuum rather than discrete groups. The first axis, which explained most of the variation (65.6%), was influenced by NAR, RGR, stomatal conductance and total biomass, and was strongly correlated with species regeneration status.;;;;;;;;;113;9;112;7;133;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NL94400016;

During one experiment, containerized 'Franksred' red maple [Acer rubrum L. 'Franksred' (trademark = Red Sunset)], sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana L.), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.), bald cypress [Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.], and pawpaw [Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal.] mere treated with various irrigation regimes for up to 118 days. Net assimilation rate (NAR) and relative growth rate (RGR) were reduced more by flooding than by drought for plants of ail tare, except pawpaw, which showed similar NAR and RGR during flooding and drought. Only sweetbay magnolia and bald cypress maintained positive NAR and RGR during flooding, and sweetbay magnolia was the only taxon that did not produce significantly less leaf surface area, shoot dry mass, and root dry mass during flooding and drought. Apparent morphological mechanisms of stress resistance included an increase in specific mass of leaves (mg-cm(-2)) during drought for red maple and bald cypress and a 385% increase in the root : shoot mass ratio for droughted plants of pawpaw. Leaf water relations of drought- and flood-stressed 'Franksred' red maple and sweetbay magnolia were determined in a second experiment. Predawn and mid-day leaf water potential (psi) decreased with decreasing root-zone matric potential for both taxa, and transpiration rate was reduced by drought and flooding. Pressure-volume analysis showed that leaves of 'Franksred' red maple responded to drought by shifting symplastic water to the apoplast. Leaves of drought-stressed sweetbay magnolia adjusted osmotically by reducing osmotic potential (psi(pi)) at full turgor by 0.26 MPa. Our results suggest that sweetbay magnolia and bald cypress will perform well at urban planting sites where episodes of drought and flooding regularly occur.;;;;;;;;;24;0;21;0;24;0003-1062;;WOS:A1993MP53100029;

Covering the container medium with polyethylene reduced evaporative losses from 13% to 88%, depending on plant species, without affecting growth. The greatest reduction in evaporation occurred in plants with open canopies and low T rates. The shrub/tree species Lagerstroemia indica had the highest NAR and RGR, while the prostrate (plagiotropic) ground covers Trachelospermum asiaticum and Jasminum floridum and the orthotropic shrub/tree species Ligustrum japonicum had the lowest NAR and RGR. Leaf area ratio was greatest in Ligustrum and Pittosporum tobira. Water consumption, leaf area and root:shoot ratio were greatest in Lagerstroemia.

The growth analysis includes both a conventional growth analysis and an integrated analysis of growth and environmental conditions. Survival was best after soil surface modification or weed control. Growth responses were positively related to increases in soil temperature and nutrient availability, and a decrease in vegetative competition. Yield component analysis indicated that Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) was positively related to improved growth. Changes in Specific Leaf Area tended to buffer the effects of changes in NAR on growth, however, and Relative Growth Rate (RGR) responded less to the treatments than did NAR. RGR was related to the availability of light, nitrogen, and soil energy or the efficiency of light, nitrogen, and soil energy use by seedlings on the three sites. As availability of a particular resource improved, growth allocation shifted away from tissues that are used to acquire that resource. Seedlings grew faster where treatments caused both the availability of a resource and the efficiency (growth/unit resource) of its use to increase. The analytical framework proposed has application in studying the responses of trees to environmental changes and in determining factors that limit tree growth.;;;;;;;;;55;0;43;0;55;0015-749X;;WOS:A1991FD75700006;

Changes in light environment and growth response of the trees were followed during the next 2 growing seasons. The relative growth rate (RGR) of thinned balsam firs increased during both the first and the second growing season. This increase in growth was attributed to a greater net assimilation rate (NAR) which was associated with a higher level of light availability. Thinning tended to positively affect the RGR of white birch during the first summer following treatment but not during the second growing season. Similar fluctuations were noted for NAR even though light levels remained high for thinned white birch trees during both the first and the second growing season. Balsam fir produced more sapwood per unit of additional leaf area than controls during the first summer following treatment but no differences were observed during the second. The sapwood area growth to leaf area growth ratios of thinned and control white birches were similar during both the first and the second summer following thinning. Thus the sapwood area-leaf area relationship appears to be more stable following abrupt changes in environmental conditions for the indeterminate growth species, white birch, than for the determinate growth species, balsam fir.;;;;;;;;;27;0;22;0;27;mars-12;;WOS:A1991FJ96700001;

Maximum net assimilation rate (NAR) of all 4 species occurred in the treatment allowed to dry out to a matric potential of -5 joules/hg (about 0.5 atm. soil moisture tension), that is, a water potential of -20 j/hg. Spruce was the most sensitive and aspen the least to the wetter treatment (watered twice a day) and to the drier treatments (watered when the matric potential had reached -10, and -20 or -40 j/hg). Leaf area ratio (LAR) of aspen and birch was greater in the wet treatment and hence relative growth rate (RGR) was less affected than NAR. Maximum aspen RGR occurred in this treatment; otherwise RGR closely paralleled NAR because LAR showed little response to the dry treatments. The larger LAR of aspen and birch in the wet treatment resulted from a larger ratio of leaf area/leaf dry wt. and not from an increase in leaf weight. The root dry wt./shoot dry wt. ratio (R/S) followed the same general pattern as NAR, except for pine which had the greatest root development in the wet treatment. Spruce and birch R/""S, and spruce water use, was lower in the wet treatment than in the driest treatment, suggesting that the sensitivity of growth and transpiration of these plants was related to reduced root activity. Aspen and birch plants of similar leaf areas transpired about the same rate. Pine water use was greatly reduced by the dry treatments and dry matter production per unit of water transpired increased greatly. Spruce was unable to control water loss effectively and had the lowest assimilation/transpiration ratio. Differences between species are discussed in relation to the development of water potentials in the leaves sufficient to close the stomata, (principally: effective root length, resistance within the plant, relations between stomatal aperture, cell water potential and water content, and the external resistance to movement of water from the leaves).";;;;;;;;;48;0;46;0;48;;;BCI:BCI19634400003532;

All seedlings in sample plots of 0.1-0.2 m2 were samples 10 times between April 15 and July 27, and fresh weight of leaves, branches, and stems were measured and dry weight of these and the roots were estimated by sub-sampling. Weight and area of leaves per unit area increased rapidly until maximum values were attained about 50 days after the beginning of leaf development, and then decreased gradually until the end of the study. The maximum area and weight of leaves per unit area of land was 2-3 times as large as in mature stands of hardwoods reported by many authors. The ratios of leaf area to weight and water content of the leaves were high while the amount of leaves was increasing, then they decreased to nearly constant values. The RGR (relative growth rate) and NAR (net assimilation rate) were high while leaves were growing rapidly, with the increase in dry weight mostly in leaves. Then these values slowed down for a while and then increased again in late June. The seasonal changes in LAR (leaf area ratio) were nearly the same as those of the amount of leaves. The vertical distribution of leaves shifted with lapse of time. At first, trees had leaves even at the lowest stratum, but as they fell gradually from below, the lowest limit of leaves was 80 cm from the ground at the end of the study. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T.

Functional groups of species may differ in any of these traits, potentially resulting in (1) differences in mean RGR of groups, and (2) differences in the traits driving RGR variation within each group. We tested these predictions by comparing deciduous and evergreen savanna trees.Methods RGR, changes to biomass allocation and leaf morphology, and root non-structural carbohydrate reserves were evaluated for juveniles of 51 savanna species (34 deciduous, 17 evergreen) grown in a common garden experiment. It was anticipated that drivers of RGR would differ between leaf habit groups because deciduous species have to allocate carbohydrates to storage in roots to be able to flush leaves again, which directly compromises their LMF, whereas evergreen species are not subject to this constraint.Key Results Evergreen species had greater LMF and RGR than deciduous species. Among deciduous species LMF explained 27% of RGR variation (SLA 34% and NAR 29 %), whereas among evergreen species LMF explained between 2 and 17% of RGR variation (SLA 32-35% and NAR 38-62 %). RGR and LMF were (negatively) related to carbohydrate storage only among deciduous species.Conclusions Trade-offs between investment in carbohydrate reserves and growth occurred only among deciduous species, leading to differences in relative contribution made by the underlying components of RGR between the leaf habit groups. The results suggest that differences in drivers of RGR occur among savanna species because these have different selected strategies for coping with fire disturbance in savannas. It is expected that variation in the drivers of RGR will be found in other functional types that respond differently to particular disturbances.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0305-7364;;WOS:000340434200011;24958787

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effect of increased N availability on growth and functional attributes of seedlings of five tree species with different life history characteristics under varying irradiances. The following questions have been addressed: (i) how do the pioneer and non-pioneer species respond in absolute growth and relative growth rate (RGR) to the interaction of light and nitrogen? (ii) how does the interaction between irradiance and nitrogen availability modulate growth attributes (i.e. functional attributes)? (iii) is there any variation in growth responses between leguminous and non-leguminous species along the light and nitrogen gradients?MethodsSeedlings of five tree species (Acacia catechu, Bridelia retusa, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia arjuna) were subjected to twelve combinations of irradiance and N levels. Various growth traits, including height (HT), basal area (BA), whole plant dry biomass (M-D), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net assimilation rate (NAR), RGR, biomass fractions, root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) and leaf nitrogen content, were studied to analyse intra-and inter-specific responses to interacting light and N gradients.Important FindingsSignificant interactions for irradiance and N availability for majority of growth attributes indicates that growth and biomass allocation of seedlings were more responsive to N availability under high irradiance. However, species responded differentially to N addition and they did not follow successional status. Slow growers (B. retusa, a shade-tolerant species and L. parviflora, a light demander) exhibited greater response to N enrichment than the fast growers (A. catechu, D. sissoo and T. arjuna). However, N-mediated increment in growth traits was greater in non-legumes (B. retusa, L. parviflora and T. arjuna) compared with that of legumes (A. catechu and D. sissoo). Allocation of biomass to root was strongly suppressed at the highest N supply across species; however, at high irradiance and high N availability, a greater suppression in R: S ratio was observed for B. retusa. NAR was a stronger determinant of RGR relative to LAR, suggesting its prominent role in increased RGR along increasing irradiances. Overall, a higher growth response of slow-growing species to elevated N levels, particularly the non-pioneers (B. retusa and L. parviflora) suggests that future N deposition may lead to perturbations in competition hierarchies and species composition, ultimately affecting community dynamics in nutrient-poor tropical dry forests.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1752-9921;;WOS:000337063500005;

In these forests, the natural light and soil moisture conditions are being altered by different human activities, as river channelization and regulation. These new environmental conditions may favor invasive species to the detriment of natives. In order to predict potential shifts of species composition in inner Spain riparian forests, we experimentally compared seedling and sapling performance across the four invasive and the three native mentioned species. Seeds were sown along an experimental gradient with four levels of light (100, 65, 35, 7 % of full irradiance) factorially combined with two levels of soil moisture (61 and 40 % of soil gravimetric water content). We compared plant biomass at the end of the first and second growing seasons, relative growth rates, biomass allocation to roots (RWR), stems (SWR) and leaves (LWR), time to emergence (T-emerg) and net assimilation rate per unit of leaf mass (NAR(m)) between origins and across species. Biomass accumulation greatly varied across species. However, invaders did not grow on average more than natives. Under high resource conditions, all species tended to grow more and similarly. Only the native U. minor and the invader A. negundo were not hampered by low moisture and/or low light availabilities. The absence of superiority of invaders over natives suggests that the former will not displace the latter in inner Spain riparian forests. However, human activities promoting shade and drought stress in floodplains may benefit the invasive A. negundo in the long term, as the growth of its seedlings is less declined by these conditions than the growth of the rest of the studied species. Thus, management effort should be focused in monitoring and preventing this species spread.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1387-3547;;WOS:000330618700003;

This study aimed to theoretically and experimentally demonstrate whether these observed L/R and N(area) are explained as optimal biomass allocation that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate (RGR). We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N(area) in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10% x nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N(area) is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N(area) of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums. From the model predictions and pot experiments, we conclude that the pioneer trees, M. bombycis and A. buergerianum, regulated L/R and N(area) to maximize RGR in response to nitrogen and light availability.;;;;;;;;;9;1;7;0;9;1932-6203;;WOS:000292699000033;21765957

We examined to what extent leaf life span is related to inter- and intraspecific variation in seedling relative growth rate (RGR). We examined relationships between relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) and leaf life span, together with classical RGR(M) components [net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and leaf area ratio (LAR)] for seedlings of five hardwood species of different successional position across a wide range of environmental resource availability, including the presence or absence of leaf litter in shaded forest understory, small canopy gaps, and large canopy gaps. Both SLA and LAR were negatively correlated with RGR(M) along the environmental gradient for all species. However, positive correlations were observed among species within microsites, indicating that these two components cannot consistently explain the variation in RGR(M). Both NAR and LWR affect interspecific, but not intraspecific, variation in RGR(M). Leaf life span was negatively correlated with either RGR(M) or RGR(H) in both inter- and intraspecific comparisons. Species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth rates, particularly in resource-rich environments. Consequently, leaf life span is a good predictor of seedling RGR. Leaf life span affects plant performance and has a strong and consistent effect on tree seedling growth, even among contrasting environments.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0912-3814;;WOS:000286431900018;

The ornamental plant trade, forestry, and agriculture have been responsible for the initial introduction of over 60% of invasive alien plant species. Screening tools to test potentially new horticultural species should help curtail the continued introduction of new invaders.2. Using two methods for analysing phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of known invasive and non-invasive, exotic woody horticultural species, we tested the potential of relative growth rate (RGR) and related traits including net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), and specific leaf area (SLA) as predictors of invasiveness. These 29 PICs include 65 species and broadly cover angiosperms.3. Without accounting for phylogeny, no significant differences were found in seedling RGR or related traits between invasive and non-invasive woody species. Using PICs, invasive species' RGRs were significantly higher. RGR was considerably more significant using our extensive dataset than in previous smaller studies, while SLA and LAR remained marginally significant. NAR was significantly higher for invasives for the 10-20 days interval.4. Analysis of this broad data set confirms that RGR is significantly higher for invasive woody species than their non-invasive counterparts, and may serve as a useful biological predictor of invasiveness for woody angiosperms. This expanded study shows that plant species use different physiological and biomass allocation patterns to achieve higher RGR; therefore individual components of RGR, such as SLA, do not consistently predict potential invasiveness of species.5. Synthesis and applications. Comparative seedling RGR studies show that this measure has potential as a screening tool for new exotic plant species. Unfortunately, more easily measurable components of RGR do not consistently predict invasiveness, as previously thought. Using seedling RGR analysis as an invasive species' screening tool requires growing a species proposed for introduction with related invasive and non-invasive species. If the tested species' RGR is higher or not significantly different from its known invasive counterpart, it should be considered highly likely to become invasive, and excluded from further consideration as a potential horticultural species. Seedling RGR could potentially produce a useful, straightforward screening tool when phylogenetically related species or cultivars are available.";;;;;;;;;12;0;12;1;13;0021-8901;;WOS:000283983200019;

Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR).

Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.;;;;;;;;;5;1;2;2;7;0167-4366;;WOS:000268865600005;

We predicted that Q. pyrenaica would behave more as a stress-tolerant species, with lower specific leaf area (SLA), allocation to leaf mass, and growth rate and less responsiveness to light in these metrics, than Q. petraea, presumed to be more competitive when resources, especially light and water, are abundant. Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL. They also displayed a higher proportion of biomass in stems (SMF), and a lower root to shoot ratio (R/S) in HL than those of Q. pyrenaica, which sprouted profusely, and had higher rates of photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(wv)), but lower whole-plant net assimilation rate (NAR).

We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.";;;;;;;;;26;1;24;1;27;1445-4408;;WOS:000259306500007;

Plants encounter a variety of light and nutrient availabilities during succession. However, there is an ongoing debate to which extent light-dependent structural and physiological plasticity is associated with species shade tolerance.2. Seedlings of five species, Betula pubescens Ehrh., B. pendula Roth, Populus tremula L., Quercus robur L. and Acer platanoides L. (from most intolerant to most shade-tolerant), were grown at four different light and nutrient availabilities to test the hypotheses that intolerant species have higher physiological and tolerant species higher structural plasticity to light and also that there is an overall increase in plasticity with increasing nutrient availability. Two replicate experiments in different years were conducted. Plasticity was characterized by four estimates: (1) the range of variation of the components of relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) (RGR = LAR.NAR) at common RGR; (2) average standardized slopes of physiological (RGR, NAR, i.e. physiological plasticity, Pi(P)) and structural (LAR, leaf dry mass per unit area, biomass allocation traits, i.e. structural plasticity, Pi(S)) traits vs. irradiance relationships; (3) standardized difference of plant traits measured at low to medium irradiance; (4) coefficient of variation across different irradiance treatments.3. Plant growth was more strongly associated with NAR than with structural traits, but shade-intolerant species had a greater range of variation in both NAR and LAR at a common RGR. RGR, NAR and structural characteristics also responded more strongly to increases in irradiance in shade-intolerant species, but at low irradiance RGR and NAR were similar among all species. Owing to higher biomass fraction in leaves, the intolerant species produced less woody biomass. In nonfertilized plants, both Pi(P) and Pi(S) were negatively associated with shade tolerance. The plasticity was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the nutrient-dependent enhancement in plasticity was greater in more tolerant species. Therefore, differences in plasticity among species of varying tolerance were lower at higher nutrient availability.4. Our study does not support the hypothesis of a trade-off between structural and physiological plasticity. Shade-tolerant species are generally less plastic than intolerant species, but increases in nutrient availability during succession reduce the differences in plasticity. Despite similar RGR in low light, first-year seedlings of shade-tolerant species produce more woody biomass, favouring survival and growth in subsequent years.";;;;;;;;;54;12;46;3;68;0269-8463;;WOS:000243412200007;

Cecropia seedlings showed greater trait plasticity at the 2-15% light interval, whereas Cedrela seedlings showed a slight tendency to present greater trait plasticity at the 15-30% light interval than the 2-15% interval.

The general responses to light gradient in these two species indicate their relative tolerance and ability to grow at low and high light and provide traits used in coping with gap dynamics.

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-301% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0266-4674;;WOS:000242132900005;

Compared to CO2, light and water treatment had greater effects on all morphological traits measured (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, biomass fractions). Cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO2 under low-watered (W-) and high-illuminated conditions (L+). Allocation shifted from shoot to root under increasing irradiance (L+), but was not affected by CO2. Changes in allocation related to water limitation were only modest, and changed over time. Relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were significantly greatest in the L+/W+ treatment for both CO2 concentrations. Changes in RGR were mainly due to NAR. Growth responses to increased light, water or CO2 were strongest with light, medium with water availability and smallest for CO2, in terms of RGR. The rise in NAR for light and water treatments was counterbalanced by a decrease in SLA (specific leaf area) and LMF (leaf mass fraction). Results suggest that elevated CO2 caused cork oak seedlings to improve their performance in dry and high light environments to a greater extent than in well-irrigated and low light ones, thus ameliorating the effects of soil water stress and high light loads on growth.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0931-1890;;WOS:000242296600006;

LMR was never strongly related to RGR. In general, NAR was the best general predictor of variation in RGR.

We tested for significant interactive effects of light and nutrient availabilities on foliage architecture, chemistry, biomass allocation and growth in shade intolerant temperate deciduous trees Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh. First-year seedlings were grown at four irradiance and four N and P availability combinations, and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. In both species, increases in light availability resulted in larger net assimilation rate (NAR, total plant biomass production rate per unit leaf area), root mass fraction (F-R) and leaf mass per unit area M-A but reductions in leaf area ratio (LAR, foliage area per total plant dry mass), stem mass fraction (F-S) and leaf mass fraction (F-L). The strong decrease in LAR (LAR = F-L/M-A) With light mainly resulted from increases in MA. The light-dependent increase in NAR was larger than the decline in LAR such that plant relative growth rate (RGR = NAR x LAR) scaled positively with light in both species. Nutrient availability mainly enhanced LAR, and moderately NAR, further improving RGR. The increase in LAR was primarily associated with increases in F-L and decreases in FR. Significant interactions between light and nutrients were found for most of the studied variables, overall indicating that plant allocation and growth were more responsive to nutrients at higher light availability. Several significant species and year-to-year differences were observed among the allocation and growth characteristics that were driven by plant size, climate and seedling source. Greater RGR of B. pubescens that is a species colonizing habitats with lower nutrient availability was linked to its greater foliage nitrogen concentrations. Overall, the study highlights a significant light x nutrient interaction that can modify seedling performance along natural gap-understory gradients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

Dry mass weighted average nitrogen (N-W) and phosphorus (P-W) contents were higher in P. sylvestris in sand dunes than in those in the raised bog, but P-W/N-W ratios overlapped between the sites. Leaf dry mass ratio (F-L) and leaf-area ratio (LAR) increased with N-W, and F-L increased with P-W. The relative growth rate (R-G) was more strongly associated with P-W than with N-W. The net assimilation rate per leaf dry mass (NAR(M)) scaled positively with P-W but not with N-W, demonstrating that the stronger effect of P-W on growth was due to modified biomass allocation and physiology (R-G = NAR(M) x F-L), while N-W affected growth via biomass allocation. Partitioning and growth characteristics were poorly related to the P-W/N-W ratio. The overall decrease of growth in larger trees resulted from their lower LAR and F-L. Increases in size further led to a lower N-W but higher P-W. We conclude that optimum productivity at a given N-W requires a certain minimum P-W, not a specific ""non-limiting"" P-W/N-W ratio.

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;21;1435-8603;;WOS:000232416400006;16163613

The slow-growing species, i.e. woody perennial shrubs, had the lowest SLA and the fast-growing perennial herbs, the highest, while woody semi-deciduous shrubs appeared intermediate. Decreases in RGR due to water stress were analysed in terms of the relative contribution of the leaf mass ratio (LMR), SLA and the net assimilation rate (NAR). Pooling all species, the decrease in RGR caused by water deficit was mainly explained by decreases in SLA. However, this general pattern was strongly dependent of growth form. Thus, in the woody perennial plants, the decrease in RGR was accompanied by a three-fold decrease in NAR which, however, increased in perennial herbs. SLA increased with decreasing water supply in woody perennial plants, and decreased in woody semi-deciduous shrubs and perennial herbs. Finally, decreases in LMR partly explained decreases in RGR in perennial herbs and woody perennial shrubs. This different response of the different growth forms may reflect differences in seedling adaptation and surviving strategies to drought periods.;;;;;;;;;32;1;30;0;34;0029-8549;;WOS:000231779500003;15868165
NAR;J;"Poorter, L; Rose, S";;;;;;;;Light-dependent changes in the relationship between seed mass and seedling traits: a meta-analysis for rain forest tree species;;;;;;;;OECOLOGIA;;;;142;3;;;378;387;;10.1007/s00442-004-1732-y;;;janv-05;2005;Seed mass is considered to be an important attribute for the establishment success of plant species being linked with their seed production, establishment, and survival. This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.;;;;;;;;;42;6;41;3;49;0029-8549;;WOS:000226357400005;15503163

Don) and Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold et Zucc.) Endl.), potted seedlings were grown in well-watered soil (wet treatment) or in drying soil (dry treatment) for 12 weeks. Seedlings in the wet treatment were watered once every 2 or 3 days, whereas seedlings in the dry treatment were watered when soil water content (theta; m(3) m(-3)) reached 0.30, equivalent to a soil matric potential of -0.06 MPa. From Weeks 7 to 12 after the onset of the treatments, seedling transpiration was measured by weighing the potted seedlings. After the last watering, changes in transpiration rate during soil drying were monitored intensely. The dry treatment restricted aboveground growth but increased biomass allocation to the roots in both species, resulting in no significant treatment difference in whole-plant biomass production. The species showed similar responses in relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and shoot mass ratio (SMR) to the dry treatment. Although NAR did not change significantly in either C. japonica or C. obtusa as the soil dried, the two species responded differently to the dry treatment in terms of mean transpiration rate (E) and water-use efficiency (WUE), which are parameters that relate to NAR. In the dry treatment, both E and WUE of C. japonica were stable, whereas in C. obtusa, E decreased and WUE increased (E and WUE counterbalanced to maintain a constant NAR). Transpiration rates were lower in C. obtusa seedlings than in C. japonica seedlings, even in well-watered conditions. During soil drying, the transpiration rate decreased after 0 reached about 0.38 (-0.003 MPa) in C. obtusa and 0.32 (-0.028 MPa) in C. japonica. We conclude that C. obtusa has more water-saving characteristics than C. japonica, particularly when water supply is limited.";;;;;;;;;17;1;18;1;20;0829-318X;;WOS:000224970700002;15339729

At low and high salinities, the VLO/SAO/CM combination had higher mean RGR than VLO/CM. Under control conditions, the increase in RGR caused by the interstock was the result of an increase in leaf mass fraction (LMF; leaf dry mass/plant dry mass ratio). Increases in net assimilation rate on a leaf mass basis (NAR(m)) and LMF contributed equally to the increase in RGR in saline conditions, their growth response coefficients being 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. The structural modifications, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR; leaf area: plant dry mass ratio), had a slight influence on the reduction in RGR by salinity. However, NAR(m) had a large influence on RGR, except in CM. The interstock-induced mechanism increased biomass allocation to the assimilatory organs and, under saline conditions, increased Cl- and Na+ allocations to roots. Thus, the flux of ions to the leaves was either delayed or reduced or both. The dilution of imported ions by foliar growth reduced ion concentrations in leaves, resulting in higher NAR(m), which together with higher LMF, increased RGR.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0829-318X;;WOS:000224449200004;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Germination tests were conducted under five osmotic potential levels. Seedlings from large (LS) and small (SS) seeds were grown at four soil moisture levels. Observations were made on height, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits such as relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Seeds of pioneer species and large seeds, within species, germinated earlier, and with increasing water stress, per cent germination and germination velocity declined. RGR was inversely related with drought tolerance. R:S ratio increased, RGR and SLA declined, but NAR increased with water stress. Notwithstanding successional status, the slow-growing species registered minimum reduction in biomass due to water stress. The response of LS and SS seedlings also differed for some of the growth variables. Increase in NAR could be a compensatory response to water stress, and the marked allocational plasticity could help maximize capture of the limited resource. Seedlings from smaller seeds, particularly of fast-growing species, would be able to cope with mild drought by morphogenetic and physiological plastic response in a better way than those from large seeds. However, seedlings from large seeds had greater survival than those from smaller seeds under intense water stress.;;;;;;;;;28;1;28;0;30;0266-4674;;WOS:000222985200004;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Seedlings from large (LS) and small seeds ( SS) were grown at two CO2 levels ( ambient and elevated, 700 - 750 ppm). CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and foliar N were determined after 30 d exposure to elevated CO2. Seedlings were harvested after 30 d and 60 d exposure periods. Height, diameter, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits (RGR, NAR, SLA, R: S) were determined. Seedling biomass across species was positively related with seed mass. Within species, LS seedlings exhibited greater biomass than SS seedlings. Elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass for all the species. The relative growth rate ( RGR), net assimilation rate ( NAR), CO2 assimilation rate, R: S ratio and water use efficiency increased under elevated CO2. However, the positive impact of elevated CO2 was down regulated beyond 30 d exposure. Specific leaf area ( SLA), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance declined due to exposure to elevated CO2. Fast growing, early successional species exhibited greater RGR, NAR and CO2 assimilation rate. Per cent enhancement in such traits was greater for slow growing species. The responses of individual species did not follow functional types (viz. legumes, non-legumes). The enhancement in biomass and RGR was greater for large-seeded species and LS seedlings within species.

I compared photosynthetic physiology, growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of three shade-tolerant tree species, Virola koschynii Warb., Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record & Mell and Brosimum alicastrum Swartz., growing across a light gradient created by a forest-pasture edge (0.5 to 67% diffuse transmittance (%T)). Most growth and physiological traits showed nonlinear responses to light availability, with the greatest changes occurring between 0.5 and 20 %T. Specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen per unit leaf mass (N(mass)) decreased, maximum assimilation per unit leaf area (A(area)) and area-based leaf N concentration (N(area)) increased, and maximum assimilation per unit leaf mass (A(mass)) did not change with increasing irradiance. Plastic responses in SLA were important determinants of leaf N and A a across the gradient. Species differed in magnitude and plasticity of growth; B. alicastrum had the lowest relative growth rates (RGR) and low plasticity. Its final biomass varied only 10-fold across the light gradient. In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.";;;;;;;;;34;0;34;1;35;0829-318X;;WOS:000188786300003;14676032

A key factor in the growth response of trees to elevated [CO2] is the availability of nitrogen, although how elevated [CO2] influences the rate of N-2-fixation of nodulated trees growing under field conditions is unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we measured total biomass, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area and net photosynthetic rate of N-2-fixing Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (common alder) trees grown for 3 years in open-top chambers in the presence of either ambient or elevated atmospheric [CO2] and two soil N regimes: full nutrient solution or no fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation by Frankia spp. in the root nodules of unfertilized trees was assessed by the acetylene reduction method. We hypothesized that unfertilized trees would show similar positive growth and physiological responses to elevated [CO2] as the fertilized trees.Growth in elevated [CO2] stimulated (relative) net photosynthesis and (absolute) total biomass accumulation. Relative total biomass increased, and leaf nitrogen remained stable, only during the first year of the experiment. Toward the end of the experiment, signs of photosynthetic acclimation occurred, i.e., down-regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Relative growth rate was not significantly affected by elevated [CO2] because although NAR was increased, the effect on relative growth rate was negated by a reduction in leaf area ratio. Neither leaf area nor leaf P concentration was affected by growth in elevated [CO2].Nodule mass increased on roots of unfertilized trees exposed to elevated [CO2] compared with fertilized trees exposed to ambient [CO2]. There was also a biologically significant, although not statistically significant, stimulation of nitrogenase activity in nodules exposed to elevated [CO2]. Root nodules of trees exposed to elevated [CO2] were smaller and more evenly spaced than root nodules of trees exposed and [CO2] effects on growth, biomass and photosynthesis indicates that the unfertilized trees maintained similar CO2-induced growth and photosynthetic enhancements as the fertilized trees. This implies that alder trees growing in natural conditions, which are often limited by soil N availability, should nevertheless benefit from increasing atmospheric [CO2].;;;;;;;;;19;0;18;0;20;0829-318X;;WOS:000186057000005;12975129

However, there were clear differences in allocation patterns and in phenotypic responses to light intensity. Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA).4 Savanna species also exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and net assimilation rate in response to light intensity. An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs.

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg.

Three separate experiments were conducted, involving 27 herbaceous species and 14 woody species aged 15-30 days, in order to determine the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in explaining interspecific variations in relative growth rate.2. Daily quantum inputs were 31.12 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the first experiment and 33.17 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the second and third experiments. This is about twice the typical irradiance of most other experiments in this area, but only about 85% of the daily photon flux in nature. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic sand culture in a solution containing 5.8 mm nitrogen.3. RGR was strongly and positively correlated with NAR in all three experiments. RGR was weakly and negatively correlated with SLA, while the correlation between RGR and LWR was weak and variable.4. These results are compared to those already published in the literature: the commonly reported result that interspecific variation in RGR is determined primarily by SLA is partly due to the low irradiance used in most experiments, and the relative importance of SLA and NAR changes depending on irradiance.5. A hypothesis is proposed in which direct and indirect effects of SLA on each of NAR and RGR are decomposed, and which leads to a trade-off between SLA and NAR as a function of daily irradiance.;;;;;;;;;84;9;81;1;97;0269-8463;;WOS:000178119300016;

Abaxial leaf surfaces of F. velutina were the most pubescent. Across species, drought led to lower ratios of leaf surface area to root DW, and leaf DW to root DW. Quercus buckleyi plants subjected to drought had the highest root to shoot DW ratio (3.1). The low relative growth rate of Q. buckleyi might limit widespread landscape use. However, Q. buckleyi may merit increased use in landscapes on a reduced moisture budget because of foliar traits, carbon allocation patterns, ana the relative lack of impact of drought on plant tissue water relations.;;;;;;;;;13;0;14;0;17;0003-1062;;WOS:000173901200011;

However, a daily mean air temperature exceeding 30 degreesC under the 5 degreesC warmer condition caused a marked reduction in net assimilation rate (NAR) from July to September. The CO2 enrichment further enhanced the positive effects of warming in spring and the resulting increases in NAR almost completely compensated for the negative effect of warming during summer.

In contrast to studies with herbaceous species at lower light, net assimilation rate (NAR) contributed more than leaf area ratio (LAR) or specific leaf area (SLA) to interspecific variation in RGR. This was associated with a larger interspecific variation in NAR than found in experiments with lower light. Without the two most shade-tolerant species, however, the contribution of LAR and its components to interspecific variation in RGR was similar or even higher than that of NAR. Leaf dry matter content correlated negatively with RGR and was the only component of LAR contributing in a similar manner to variation in LAIR and RGR. There was a positive correlation between NAR and biomass allocation to roots, which may be a result of nutrient-limited growth. RGR correlated negatively with biomass allocation to leaves. Leaf thickness did not correlate with RGR, as the positive effect of thin leaves was counterbalanced by their lower NAR. Low inherent RGR was associated with species from nutrient-poor or shady habitats. Different components constrained growth for these two groups of species, those from nutrient-poor habitats having high leaf dry matter content, while those from shady habitats had thin leaves with low NAR.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;1435-8603;;WOS:000170738300017;

The growth response of seedlings of A. procera from seeds of different sizes was studied under four soil water levels. Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated and grown in a glasshouse for 3 weeks under optimal water supply, and were subsequently maintained at four soil water levels for 4 months. Soil matric potentials for 1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 water holding capacity (WHC) were -0.01, -0.1, -0.61 and -1.20 MPa. respectively. Plant height, stem diameter and leaf area were measured fortnightly. Seedlings were harvested at the end of the experiment. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), stem weight ratio (SWR), root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were determined. Seedlings from large seeds had a higher biomass and leaf area and were more tolerant of long-term extreme water stress compared to those from small seeds which were more tolerant of moderate levels of water stress. Seedlings from small seeds did not survive beyond 75 d at 1/4 WHC. Increase in the R:S ratio along with a decrease in SWR reflected a shift in biomass allocation from above- to below-ground parts as soil water level decreased. SLA declined sharply with increasing water stress, which in turn led to a decrease in RGR. NAR increased with water stress. The study revealed the ability of the species to acclimate to a wide range of moisture stress by morphogenetic (increased R:S ratio and decreased SWR) and physiological (increased NAR) plastic responses.

The seedlings were grown in closed-top chambers at four temperature regimes (-2.9 degrees C below ambient, ambient, + 2.3 degrees C and + 4.8 degrees C above ambient) in combination with two CO2 partial pressures (40 Pa and 74 Pa). Growth was followed by making destructive harvests c. every 25 d from germination in early June to senescence in late September. Allocation patterns were significantly affected by the temperature regimes. However, changes in dry matter allocation and morphology associated with the different treatments at a given time were mostly a result of differences in tree size. Temperature regimes only had a significant effect on the relative growth rate, RGR, at the beginning of the experiment. In contrast to temperature, high [CO2] increased RGR throughout the experiment when compared with plants of equal size. As the trees increased in size net assimilation rate, NAR, decreased but the effect of [CO2] on both NAR and RGR had a tendency to increase. Increases in NAR caused by elevated [CO2] were partly counteracted by reductions in the leaf area ratio, NAR. Reductions in LAR were caused by concomitant reductions in specific leaf area, SLA, whereas the level of [CO2] did not significantly affect leaf weight ratio, LWR, nor other dry weight ratios. The interactions between temperature and [CO2] are highly dependent on whether they are expressed as instantaneous values for plants at a common age or instantaneous values at a common size (and thereby extracting the effects of ontogenetic drift). When comparing instantaneous values at common sizes, the positive effect of [CO2] on RGR increased with plant size in every temperature regime. This also occurred in every temperature regime when comparing plants of equal age but the response to [CO2] was less. The effect of [CO2] on RGR was dependent on growth temperature. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on RGR were less than the positive effect on photosynthesis. The two provenances did not differ significantly in the response of RGR to [CO2] which is in agreement with measurements of photosynthesis.;;;;;;;;;26;0;24;0;26;0028-646X;;WOS:000088299900007;

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, SLA), net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, NARa) and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, LMR). Commonly, most cross-species variation in RGR is accounted for by variation in SLA, while no general relationships occur between RGR and either NARa or LMR. NARa can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, LNP) and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, LNCa). In this way the influence on RGR of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated.2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in SLA, LNP, LNCa and LMR explained c. 44%, 22%, 19% and 15% of variation in RGR, respectively. SLA and LNP were positively associated with RGR, while LNCa was negatively associated with RGR. LNP and LNCa were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between RGR and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between RGR and NARa. It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between NARa and RGR.3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' (NAR) and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, NUR). At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low RGR tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be co-ordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with RGR across all species.;;;;;;;;;47;21;49;2;71;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500013;

Specifically. we asked whether fast- and slow-growing species systematically differ in their response to elevated CO2. Four slow-growing species from semi-arid environments (Acacia aneura, A. colei, A. coriacea and A. tetragonophylla) and six fast-growing species from mesic environments (Acacia dealbata, A. implexa, A. mearnsii, A. melanoxylon, A. irrorata and A. saligna) were grown in glasshouses with either ambient (similar to 350 ppm) or elevated (similar to 700 ppm) atmospheric CO2. All species reached greater final plant mass with the exception of A. aneura, and RGR, averaged across all species, increased by 10% over a 12-week period when plants were exposed to elevated CO2. The stimulation of RGR was evident throughout the 12-week growth period. Elevated CO2 resulted in less foliage area per unit foliage dry mass, which was mainly the result of an increase in foliage thickness with a smaller contribution from greater dry matter content per unit fresh mass. The net assimilation rate (NAR, increase in plant mass per unit foliage area and time) of the plants grown at elevated CO2 was higher in all species (on average 30% higher than plants in ambient CO2) and was responsible for the increase in RGR. The higher NAR was associated with a substantial increase in foliar nitrogen productivity in all ten Acacia species. Plant nitrogen concentration was unaltered by growth at elevated CO2 for the slow-growing Acacia species, but declined by 10% for faster-growing species. The rate of nitrogen uptake per unit root mass was higher in seven of the species when grown under elevated CO2, and leaf area per unit root mass was reduced by elevated CO2 in seven of the species. The absolute increase in RGR due to growth under elevated CO2 was greater for fast- than for slow-growing Acacia species.;;;;;;;;;47;0;41;0;47;0029-8549;;WOS:000082858900010;

Classical growth analysis was applied to both species and mean current relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T) and leaf dry mass (R-L), and period relative growth rate of total dry mass (R-T(t)) and leaf dry mass (R-L(t)) were calculated. Sitka spruce saplings and cherry seedlings showed a positive growth response to elevated [CO2], and at the end of the experiments both species were approximate to 40% larger in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. As a result, the period mean R-T(t) and R-L(t) were significantly higher in elevated [CO2]. The differences in plant dry mass at the end of the experiments were a consequence of the more rapid growth in the early phase of exposure to elevated [CO2]. After this initial phase mean R-T and R-L were similar or even lower in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. NAR of both species was much higher in elevated [CO2], whereas both LAR, SLA, and LMR showed the opposite trend. The higher LAR and SLA of plants in ambient [CO2] contributed to a compensation by which they maintained R-T Similar to that of elevated [CO2] saplings despite lower NAR and photosynthetic rate. However, when the same size the trees were similar amongst the [CO2] treatments, indicating that one of the main effect of elevated [CO2] on tree growth is to speed-up early development in all aspects.;;;;;;;;;45;2;38;0;47;1354-1013;;WOS:000081655000001;

The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span.2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light.3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA; SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span.4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.";;;;;;;;;217;3;196;1;225;0269-8463;;WOS:000074764200001;

H and RI were independent. All allometric relationships between H and the parameters of plant biomass and dimensions were positively affected by RI, signifying that at a common H, saplings increased horizontal growth relative to vertical growth in environments with greater irradiance. Root mass ratio (coarse plus fine roots per total plant biomass) increased with increasing irradiance in both species and was not different between the species. However, Q. robur had a larger stem mass ratio, while A. platanoides had a greater leaf mass ratio (LMR). At a common irradiance, leaf mass per area (LMA) was lower in A. platanoides. As a result of these interspecific differences in fractional allocation of sapling biomass in foliage and biomass requirement for construction of foliar surface area, leaf area ratio (LAR = LMR/LMA) was larger in A. platanoides. Relative growth rate of standing biomass (RGR) was significantly correlated with RI in both species and was not different between the species. In contrast, net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR) was larger in Q. robur. Thus, in these species a similar RGR (NAR X LAR) was achieved in a completely different way: A. platanoides increased the intercepting foliar area, while Q. robur increased the productivity per unit area. Growth analysis repeated on a nitrogen basis demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency (biomass increment per unit nitrogen) was similar between the species, and that the species differences in NAR resulted from different foliar N concentrations; fractional nitrogen investment in foliage was independent of species. but lower nitrogen cost of leaves allowed A. platanoides to construct a more extensive foliar display with the same nitrogen investment in foliage. Biomass allocation between different compartments was also dependent on sapling size. With increasing H, A. platanoides maintained a constant proportion of biomass in foliage, but the relative amount of foliage decreased in Q. robur. Therefore, due to a decreasing investment of resources in foliage construction with advancing sapling ontogeny, saplings of similar height require more light to survive in Q. robur than in A. platanoides. Greater investment of biomass in leaves vs. standing biomass may result in lower volume pain and reduced competitive ability in more open habitats in A. platanoides. These results indicate that interspecific differences in allometry and nitrogen allocation patterns significantly alter species competitive relations during sapling development across the gap-understory continuum.";;;;;;;;;40;2;38;0;42;1058-5893;;WOS:000072789100018;

Irradiance influences growth directly through differences in carbon gain, and indirectly through differences in carbon partitioning. In this paper we present an analysis of the morphological and physiological factors influencing the growth rates of tropical tree seedlings with different ecological strategies.A compilation was made of published data on relative growth rates and biomass allocation of species in contrasting light environments. The compilation encompasses 43 studies and 194 species. All morphological characteristics show ontogenetic trends. Stem mass ratio (SMR) increases with plant mass, mainly at the expense of the leaf mass ratio (LMR). A concomitant decrease in specific leaf area (SLA) leads to reduced leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and hence, a lower relative growth rate (RGR) when plants increase in size. Pioneers grow faster than shade-tolerant species, not only in high light but also in low-light conditions. In low light LAR explains interspecific differences in RGR, whereas in high light differences in net assimilation rate (NAR) are more important.We then use these data and additional information on physiological processes to model carbon balances for the average pioneer and shade-tolerant species in both a low- and a high-light environment. Simulated photosynthetic carbon gain is higher in pioneers than in shade-tolerant species, in both light environments. This is due to a larger leaf area in low light, acid the combination of a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rates in high light. Patterns in biomass fractions and carbon partitioning are strikingly different. More than half of the assimilates are partitioned to the leaves (for respiration, the replacement of shed leaves and additional growth), a third is partitioned to the roots and only 15% to the stem. Stems are not a great burden on the carbon balance, due to their low respiration rates and long lifespan. At the whole plant level, respiration consumes the largest share of assimilates, followed by net growth. About 15% of the assimilates are invested in the replacement of shed plant parts.The ability of shade-tolerant species to tolerate shade, apparently reduces the maximal possible growth rate in high light. In contrast, specialization for growth in a high-light environment does not preclude reasonable growth in low light, but probably at the cost of an increased risk of mortality.;;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;105;0;99;1;107;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300019;

To test the predicted relationship between growth rate and biomass allocation in relation to nutrient availability, seedlings of 34 woody species from the tropical deciduous forest in Mexico were grown under two contrasting nutrient conditions.2. Dry biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), root/shoot ratio (R/S), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), root weight ratio (RWR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and the nitrogen and carbon leaf percentage were determined following an initial and final harvest. In all the parameters evaluated, the trend followed by the species under low nutrient conditions was similar to the trend attained in high nutrient conditions but with different magnitude.3. The species with the largest seed biomass was Thevetia ovata (3808.6mg). Lagrezia monosperma had the smallest seeds (0.13 mg) and the highest RGR in the high nutrient treatment. However, the relationship between RGR and seed biomass among the 34 species studied was weak (r=-0.50 in low and -0.62 in high nutrients).4. Higher biomass allocation to roots Was shown under low nutrient condition but the relationship between RGR and root/shoot ratio was non-significant.5. Species variation in RGR to both the nutrient treatments employed is followed by species variations in LAR (r=0.50) more than changes in NAR (r=0.20). Changes in LAR are explained by LWR (r=0.62) and SLA (r=0.70). Under low and high nutrients, the RGR was highly correlated with SLA (r=0.67 and 0.60), suggesting the importance of both the total leaf area produced and the leaf morphological characteristics in determining the RGR.6. A general characteristic of the distribution of the species' responses in RGR to both nutrient treatments was the existence of a continuum, for all of the parameters studied. This suggests differences in the species' resource utilization and tolerance, which are reflected in different plastic capacities.;;;;;;;;;73;0;69;3;74;0269-8463;;WOS:A1995TU96300006;

Plants were kept in a shade house for a period of 15 months at 37%, 10% and 2.5% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), roughly corresponding to light environments in large gaps, small gaps, and forest understorey, respectively. The species were chosen to represent a wide array of taxa, ecological, and morphological characteristics, and were assigned regeneration niche (RN) index values based on observations of life history and spatial distribution of their seedlings and saplings in various forest microsites.2 Growth, biomass allocation patterns, leaf anatomy and stomatal responses varied appreciably among species, as well as in response to shading. All species showed reduced growth with decreasing light intensity. Plants grown at 37% and 10% PAR exhibited morphological and physiological responses typical of plants found at forest edges and in large gaps: i.e. low leaf area ratio (LAR), high specific leaf weight (SLW), high root-shoot ratio (RSR), high relative growth rate (RGR), high net assimilation rate (NAR), high leaf conductance, and high chlorophyll a/b ratio. Those grown at 2.5% PAR showed the opposite trends. Comparing species within each light level, NAR and LAR showed positive correlation with RGR, but pooled data for all light levels suggests that the contribution of LAR and NAR to RGR are in opposite directions, depending on light conditions.3 Sensitivity of seedling growth to shading was significantly correlated with mean seed reserve weight of the species: small-seeded species were more affected than large-seeded ones. Relationship between seed reserve weight and species RN index value, though linear, was weak and nonsignificant. RGR was significantly correlated with seed reserve weight at 37% and 10% PAR but not at 2.5% PAR, while LAR showed the opposite trend.4 Plasticity of most parameters examined appeared highest in species that regenerate mostly in large gaps (> 200 m2) and at forest edges, and least in species that regenerate mostly in forest understorey and small gaps (< 50 m2). However, ordination of the study species, using seed size and various shade tolerance criteria for the seedlings, yielded a continuum rather than discrete groups. The first axis, which explained most of the variation (65.6%), was influenced by NAR, RGR, stomatal conductance and total biomass, and was strongly correlated with species regeneration status.;;;;;;;;;113;9;112;7;133;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NL94400016;

Net assimilation rate (NAR) and relative growth rate (RGR) were reduced more by flooding than by drought for plants of ail tare, except pawpaw, which showed similar NAR and RGR during flooding and drought. Only sweetbay magnolia and bald cypress maintained positive NAR and RGR during flooding, and sweetbay magnolia was the only taxon that did not produce significantly less leaf surface area, shoot dry mass, and root dry mass during flooding and drought. Apparent morphological mechanisms of stress resistance included an increase in specific mass of leaves (mg-cm(-2)) during drought for red maple and bald cypress and a 385% increase in the root : shoot mass ratio for droughted plants of pawpaw. Leaf water relations of drought- and flood-stressed 'Franksred' red maple and sweetbay magnolia were determined in a second experiment. Predawn and mid-day leaf water potential (psi) decreased with decreasing root-zone matric potential for both taxa, and transpiration rate was reduced by drought and flooding. Pressure-volume analysis showed that leaves of 'Franksred' red maple responded to drought by shifting symplastic water to the apoplast. Leaves of drought-stressed sweetbay magnolia adjusted osmotically by reducing osmotic potential (psi(pi)) at full turgor by 0.26 MPa. Our results suggest that sweetbay magnolia and bald cypress will perform well at urban planting sites where episodes of drought and flooding regularly occur.;;;;;;;;;24;0;21;0;24;0003-1062;;WOS:A1993MP53100029;

Covering the container medium with polyethylene reduced evaporative losses from 13% to 88%, depending on plant species, without affecting growth. The greatest reduction in evaporation occurred in plants with open canopies and low T rates. The shrub/tree species Lagerstroemia indica had the highest NAR and RGR, while the prostrate (plagiotropic) ground covers Trachelospermum asiaticum and Jasminum floridum and the orthotropic shrub/tree species Ligustrum japonicum had the lowest NAR and RGR.

The growth analysis includes both a conventional growth analysis and an integrated analysis of growth and environmental conditions. Survival was best after soil surface modification or weed control. Growth responses were positively related to increases in soil temperature and nutrient availability, and a decrease in vegetative competition. Yield component analysis indicated that Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) was positively related to improved growth. Changes in Specific Leaf Area tended to buffer the effects of changes in NAR on growth, however, and Relative Growth Rate (RGR) responded less to the treatments than did NAR. RGR was related to the availability of light, nitrogen, and soil energy or the efficiency of light, nitrogen, and soil energy use by seedlings on the three sites. As availability of a particular resource improved, growth allocation shifted away from tissues that are used to acquire that resource. Seedlings grew faster where treatments caused both the availability of a resource and the efficiency (growth/unit resource) of its use to increase. The analytical framework proposed has application in studying the responses of trees to environmental changes and in determining factors that limit tree growth.;;;;;;;;;55;0;43;0;55;0015-749X;;WOS:A1991FD75700006;

Changes in light environment and growth response of the trees were followed during the next 2 growing seasons. The relative growth rate (RGR) of thinned balsam firs increased during both the first and the second growing season. This increase in growth was attributed to a greater net assimilation rate (NAR) which was associated with a higher level of light availability. Thinning tended to positively affect the RGR of white birch during the first summer following treatment but not during the second growing season. Similar fluctuations were noted for NAR even though light levels remained high for thinned white birch trees during both the first and the second growing season. Balsam fir produced more sapwood per unit of additional leaf area than controls during the first summer following treatment but no differences were observed during the second. The sapwood area growth to leaf area growth ratios of thinned and control white birches were similar during both the first and the second summer following thinning. Thus the sapwood area-leaf area relationship appears to be more stable following abrupt changes in environmental conditions for the indeterminate growth species, white birch, than for the determinate growth species, balsam fir.;;;;;;;;;27;0;22;0;27;mars-12;;WOS:A1991FJ96700001;

Maximum net assimilation rate (NAR) of all 4 species occurred in the treatment allowed to dry out to a matric potential of -5 joules/hg (about 0.5 atm. soil moisture tension), that is, a water potential of -20 j/hg. Spruce was the most sensitive and aspen the least to the wetter treatment (watered twice a day) and to the drier treatments (watered when the matric potential had reached -10, and -20 or -40 j/hg). Leaf area ratio (LAR) of aspen and birch was greater in the wet treatment and hence relative growth rate (RGR) was less affected than NAR. Maximum aspen RGR occurred in this treatment; otherwise RGR closely paralleled NAR because LAR showed little response to the dry treatments. The larger LAR of aspen and birch in the wet treatment resulted from a larger ratio of leaf area/leaf dry wt. and not from an increase in leaf weight. The root dry wt./shoot dry wt. ratio (R/S) followed the same general pattern as NAR, except for pine which had the greatest root development in the wet treatment. Spruce and birch R/""S, and spruce water use, was lower in the wet treatment than in the driest treatment, suggesting that the sensitivity of growth and transpiration of these plants was related to reduced root activity. Aspen and birch plants of similar leaf areas transpired about the same rate. Pine water use was greatly reduced by the dry treatments and dry matter production per unit of water transpired increased greatly. Spruce was unable to control water loss effectively and had the lowest assimilation/transpiration ratio. Differences between species are discussed in relation to the development of water potentials in the leaves sufficient to close the stomata, (principally: effective root length, resistance within the plant, relations between stomatal aperture, cell water potential and water content, and the external resistance to movement of water from the leaves).";;;;;;;;;48;0;46;0;48;;;BCI:BCI19634400003532;

All seedlings in sample plots of 0.1-0.2 m2 were samples 10 times between April 15 and July 27, and fresh weight of leaves, branches, and stems were measured and dry weight of these and the roots were estimated by sub-sampling. Weight and area of leaves per unit area increased rapidly until maximum values were attained about 50 days after the beginning of leaf development, and then decreased gradually until the end of the study. The maximum area and weight of leaves per unit area of land was 2-3 times as large as in mature stands of hardwoods reported by many authors. The ratios of leaf area to weight and water content of the leaves were high while the amount of leaves was increasing, then they decreased to nearly constant values. The RGR (relative growth rate) and NAR (net assimilation rate) were high while leaves were growing rapidly, with the increase in dry weight mostly in leaves. Then these values slowed down for a while and then increased again in late June. The seasonal changes in LAR (leaf area ratio) were nearly the same as those of the amount of leaves. The vertical distribution of leaves shifted with lapse of time. At first, trees had leaves even at the lowest stratum, but as they fell gradually from below, the lowest limit of leaves was 80 cm from the ground at the end of the study. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effect of increased N availability on growth and functional attributes of seedlings of five tree species with different life history characteristics under varying irradiances. The following questions have been addressed: (i) how do the pioneer and non-pioneer species respond in absolute growth and relative growth rate (RGR) to the interaction of light and nitrogen? (ii) how does the interaction between irradiance and nitrogen availability modulate growth attributes (i.e. functional attributes)? (iii) is there any variation in growth responses between leguminous and non-leguminous species along the light and nitrogen gradients?MethodsSeedlings of five tree species (Acacia catechu, Bridelia retusa, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia arjuna) were subjected to twelve combinations of irradiance and N levels. Various growth traits, including height (HT), basal area (BA), whole plant dry biomass (M-D), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net assimilation rate (NAR), RGR, biomass fractions, root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) and leaf nitrogen content, were studied to analyse intra-and inter-specific responses to interacting light and N gradients.Important FindingsSignificant interactions for irradiance and N availability for majority of growth attributes indicates that growth and biomass allocation of seedlings were more responsive to N availability under high irradiance. However, species responded differentially to N addition and they did not follow successional status. Slow growers (B. retusa, a shade-tolerant species and L. parviflora, a light demander) exhibited greater response to N enrichment than the fast growers (A. catechu, D. sissoo and T. arjuna). However, N-mediated increment in growth traits was greater in non-legumes (B. retusa, L. parviflora and T. arjuna) compared with that of legumes (A. catechu and D. sissoo). Allocation of biomass to root was strongly suppressed at the highest N supply across species; however, at high irradiance and high N availability, a greater suppression in R: S ratio was observed for B. retusa. NAR was a stronger determinant of RGR relative to LAR, suggesting its prominent role in increased RGR along increasing irradiances. Overall, a higher growth response of slow-growing species to elevated N levels, particularly the non-pioneers (B. retusa and L. parviflora) suggests that future N deposition may lead to perturbations in competition hierarchies and species composition, ultimately affecting community dynamics in nutrient-poor tropical dry forests.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1752-9921;;WOS:000337063500005;

The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (A (max), V (cmax), J (max)) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (K (L)) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (K (R)) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.";;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0912-3814;;WOS:000318569100016;

Such an approach does not consider how patterns of nitrogen allocation may change with differences in light intensity, growing-season temperature and CO2 concentration. To account for this known variability in nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships, we develop a mechanistic nitrogen allocation model based on a trade-off of nitrogen allocated between growth and storage, and an optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The developed model is able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and radiation when evaluated against published data of V-c,V-max (maximum carboxylation rate) and J(max) (maximum electron transport rate). A sensitivity analysis of the model for herbaceous plants, deciduous and evergreen trees implies that elevated CO2 concentrations lead to lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation but higher allocation to storage. Higher growing-season temperatures cause lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation, due to higher nitrogen requirements for light capture pigments and for storage. Lower levels of radiation have a much stronger effect on allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation for herbaceous plants than for trees, resulting from higher nitrogen requirements for light capture for herbaceous plants. As far as we know, this is the first model of complete nitrogen allocation that simultaneously considers nitrogen allocation to light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, respiration and storage, and the responses of each to altered environmental conditions. We expect this model could potentially improve our confidence in simulations of carbon-nitrogen interactions and the vegetation feedbacks to climate in Earth system models.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;1932-6203;;WOS:000305335800084;22649564

Understanding ecological strategies of invasive species relative to the entire native community is important in understanding and managing both the mechanisms and the potential impacts of invasion, but few studies have taken this approach.2. We utilize advances in plant ecology to compare functional traits of an invasive shrub species, autumn-olive Elaeagnus umbellata, to those of the understorey native woody plant community in a southeast Michigan forest. We estimate species trait distributions for six leaf functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf laminar area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio and delta N-15) using a kernel estimator. We then use pairwise trait distance and overlaps to describe the ecological strategy of the invasive shrub relative to that of the native understorey woody plant community.3. The overlap of the invasive shrub's trait distribution with those of the native species was found to be smaller than the overlap of a native shrub's distribution with other native species, consistent with the empty niche hypothesis of invasion. However, the invasive species' mean leaf functional trait values typically fall outside of the range of most native species' mean trait values, suggesting the invasive shrub extends trait space for understorey individuals of the native woody plant community.4. The invasive shrub's leaf trait values are characteristic of a sun-demanding species, contradicting its presence in the shaded forest understorey community and its persistence in an empty niche. We propose that this novel use of leaf functional traits by the invasive shrub could indicate that the invasion is facilitated by additional mechanisms such as release from natural enemies, association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, use of an empty temporal niche (namely the light available to the understorey early in the growing season), bird dispersal or some synthesis of these factors.5. Synthesis and applications. This study develops plant functional trait theory by studying an invasive species within the context of the entire native woody plant community. The approach can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms of an invasion event and suggest ecological consequences and related management strategies for the maintenance of native forest communities. Specifically, this study, along with known data on the invasive species, suggests aggressive management in sunny gap and edge habitat provides the best strategy for long-term control.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;0021-8901;;WOS:000295095100005;

This study aimed to theoretically and experimentally demonstrate whether these observed L/R and N(area) are explained as optimal biomass allocation that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate (RGR). We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N(area) in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10% x nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N(area) is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N(area) of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums. From the model predictions and pot experiments, we conclude that the pioneer trees, M. bombycis and A. buergerianum, regulated L/R and N(area) to maximize RGR in response to nitrogen and light availability.;;;;;;;;;9;1;7;0;9;1932-6203;;WOS:000292699000033;21765957

However, this does not usually occur in other species, e.g., Ulmus pumila and Zizyphus jujuba. We compared stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) as indicators of leaf water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf area- and mass-based nitrogen content (N-area and N-mass) by tree height (1, 5, and 10 m) in P. hopeinsis, R. pseudoacacia, U. pumila, and Z jujuba. In P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, leaf delta C-13 and N-area were significantly lower in 10-m trees than in 1-m saplings, indicating that leaf WUE and photosynthetic rates of both species decreased with tree height. In contrast, delta C-13 in Z. jujuba varied little with tree height. The delta C-13 of 10-m-tall U. pumila trees was significantly higher than that of 1-m plants, demonstrating an increase in WUE with tree height. Decreasing WUE, leaf N-area and N-mass with height increases in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia may be related to water and nutrient limitations for these species in semiarid regions. in contrast, stable or increasing delta C-13 with tree height in U. pumila and Z jujuba may account (to some extent) for successful production of these species under identical environmental conditions. Diameter growth rate also decreased with maturity in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, but increased or was stable for U. pumila and Z. jujuba. The differences in leaf WUE and LMA among species with tree maturity may be related to species' growth patterns and susceptibility to drought stress, and are likely to be important new criteria for plantation species selection on the Loess Plateau.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils.We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.;;;;;;;;;203;13;200;0;219;d_c-15;;WOS:000263566600006;

The decreasing tree stature was attributed to a decrease in the asymptote of H in the D-0.1 (stem diameter at H/10)-H relationship toward the edge. The K. obovata trees were well classified into interior and edge types using a discriminant function based on the habitat-specific D-0.1-H relationships. Allometric equations, as a function of (D0.1H)-H-2, differed significantly between the interior and edge types in the estimation of the phytomasses of stems and leaves, and the leaf area per tree. On the other hand, common allometric equations were successfully established in the estimation of respective phytomasses of aboveground parts and branches. Biomass and leaf area index decreased toward the forest edge. The biomass allocation to stems decreased toward the edge, whereas those to branches and leaves increased. A dramatic change in stem diameter increment resulted in differences in the D-0.1-H relationship along the tree height gradient. Relative growth rate of biomass and light-saturated net photosynthesis, which paralleled net assimilation rate from the interior to the edge, showed their maximum peaks in the middle of the belt transect. This indicates that there exists an optimal environmental condition for growth of K. obovata trees.

As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.";;;;;;;;;34;0;34;1;35;0829-318X;;WOS:000188786300003;14676032

Most predation occurs on young, expanding leaves. Thus, a rapid growth of the leaves can reduce the impact of predation. Furthermore, in cold Mediterranean climates the length of the growing season is constrained to a short period in spring and early summer owing both to low winter temperatures and drought stress in early summer. Therefore, a rapid deployment of leaf area and a high photosynthetic capacity during the spring and early summer might have important positive effects on the final carbon balance of the leaf population. Relative growth rates (RGR) of leaf biomass were measured in 19 woody species typical of Central Western Spain with deciduous and evergreen habits. Highly significant differences were detected in the leaf growth rate of the different species. The differences between species, however, did not correlate either with the mean leaf life-span of each of the species or with other leaf traits such as photosynthetic capacity, specific leaf area or nitrogen content. Leaf growth rate was positively correlated with time elapsed between leaf initiation and fruit maturation, so that species with fruit dispersal in spring and early summer in general had lower leaf growth rates than species with autumn fruit shedding. This relationship shows the effects of the concurrence between vegetative and reproductive organs for nutrients and other resources. Nitrogen concentration in the leaves was very high at the time of bud break, and declined during leaf expansion owing to the dilution associated with the increase in structural components. The rate of nitrogen dilution was, thus, positively related to the leaf growth rate. Relative growth rates calculated for nitrogen mass in leaves were very low compared to the growth in total mass. This suggests that most leaf nitrogen is translocated from the plant stores to the leaf biomass before the start of leaf expansion and that the contribution of root uptake during leaf expansion is comparatively low.;;;;;;;;;24;0;22;0;27;1385-0237;;WOS:000183836200011;

Mechanisms of temperature effects on plant growth in temperate - arctic regions are discussed in the light of decreasing growth rates and increasing leaf-N contents along altitudinal and latitudinal temperature gradients.Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) seedlings were grown at two soil temperatures, air temperatures and nutrient concentrations in a full-factorial experiment during one growing season in northern Sweden.Changes in air and soil temperature affected aboveground growth more than belowground growth. An increase in air temperature increased leaf area ratio and plant-N productivity while decreasing plant-N concentration and leaf-N content. A change in soil temperature affected root-N uptake rate and plant-N concentration, similar to the effect of a change in nutrient supply. Air and soil temperature had interactive effects on growth rate, N productivity and leaf-N content.The results indicate that increasing leaf-N content with increasing altitude and latitude is not only a passive consequence of weaker N dilution by reduced growth, but also a physiological acclimation to lower air temperature.;;;;;;;;;67;3;62;0;70;0028-646X;;WOS:000167774100015;

The consistency of relationships between RGR and its component attributes leaf nitrogen productivity (LNP), leaf N per area (LNCa), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) was assessed across 12 datasets comprising three growth forms (grasses, herbaceous dicots and woody plants; 250 species in total). These relationships were characterised in terms of scaling slopes (regressions on log-log axes, the slopes giving the proportional relationship between the variables). Mathematically, the expected scaling slope between RGR and each component is 1.0, giving an appropriate null hypothesis to test against (whereas the widely used null hypothesis of zero correlation is in fact inappropriate for this situation). Deviations below 1:1 scaling slopes indicate negative covariance between the components. Consequently, the correlation structure between the components of RGR should also be investigated. Biologically, RGR should scale 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa and somewhat more weakly with LNCa at a given SLA. SLA and LNCa should themselves scale with a slope of between 0 and -1, with the actual slope indicating the extent to which between-species variation in SLA dilutes leaf N on an area basis versus the ability of species to maintain LNCa at a given growth irradiance. On average, across the 12 datasets RGR scaled close-to-proportionally with SLA, and 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa. RGR scaled with LNCa with null or negative slopes, since SLA and LNCa scaled negatively (with slopes generally shallower than -1); however, RGR scaled positively (but less than proportionally) with LNCa at a given SLA. For these key relationships there were no qualitatively different conclusions with respect to the growth form under consideration or the growth irradiance at which the seedlings were grown. RGR also scaled close-to-proportionally with LNP, while LNP and LNCa were negatively associated. These relationships involving LNP are difficult to interpret since it can be shown that they are, at least potentially, the result of the interactions between RGR, SLA and LNCa, as well as reflecting intrinsic differences in the efficiency of nitrogen use in the growth process.";;;;;;;;;51;3;49;3;56;0029-8549;;WOS:000167629200003;

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography.2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because A(max)/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and A(max)/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in A(max)/area, particularly in small saplings.3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species.4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. A(max)/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. A(max)/mass, PNUEmax and A(max)/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.;;;;;;;;;97;10;96;3;107;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500011;

For example, young expanding leaves in tree species may be less affected by enriched CO(2)-alterations in leaf phytochemistry than older mature leaves due to shorter exposure times to elevated CO(2) atmospheres. This, in turn, could result in different effects on early vs. late instar larvae of herbivorous insects. To address this, seedlings of white oak (Quercus alba L.), grown in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated CO(2), were fed to two important early spring feeding herbivores; gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.), and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner). Young, expanding leaves were presented to early instar larvae, and older fully expanded or mature leaves to late instar larvae. Young leaves had significantly lower leaf nitrogen content and significantly higher total nonstructural carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio as plant CO(2) concentration rose, while nonstructural carbohydrates and total carbon-based phenolics were unaffected by plant CO(2) treatment. These phytochemical changes contributed to a significant reduction in the growth rate of early instar gypsy moth larvae, while growth rates of forest tent caterpillar were unaffected. The differences in insect responses were attributed to an increase in the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of early instar forest tent caterpillar larvae feeding on elevated CO(2)-grown leaves, while early instar gypsy moth larval NUE remained unchanged among the treatments. Later instar larvae of both insect species experienced larger reductions in foliage quality on elevated CO(2)-grown leaves than earlier instars, as the carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves substantially increased. Despite this, neither insect species exhibited changes in growth or consumption rates between CO(2) treatments in the later instar. An increase in NUE was apparently responsible for offsetting reduced foliar nitrogen for the late instar larvae of both species.";;;;;;;;;46;15;39;0;62;1354-1013;;WOS:000072857700001;

Seedlings of 81 woody species from the temperate zone of western Europe were grown in a standard laboratory environment with standard, near-optimal nutrient availability. Weight-based leaf N content (N-wght) was positively correlated with mean relative growth rate (RGR), but the correlation with mean RGR was tighter when leaf N was expressed on a whole-plant weight basis: leaf nitrogen weight ratio (LNWR). Area-based leaf N content (N-area) was not associated with mean RGR, but was closely correlated with the quotient of saturated leaf weight and leaf area. Weight-based leaf K content (K-wght) was a close correlate of the saturated/dry weight ratio of the foliage, Within the lower range, K-wght corresponded with growth-related nutrient attributes, but higher values appeared to indicate succulence or remobilisable stored water. Functional groups of species and genera could be distinguished with respect to seedling leaf nutrient attributes. Deciduous woody climbers and scramblers had consistently higher leaf N-wght, LNWR and (apparently) leaf K-wght than other deciduous species or genera, and shrubs had higher values than trees. These differences seemed due partly to variation in specific leaf area. Evergreens had consistently higher leaf N-area than deciduous plants, but there were no significant differences in weight-based leaf nutrient attributes between these two groups, possibly because of 'luxury nutrient consumption' by the slow-growing evergreens. Another functional group was that of the nitrogen-fixing species, which had consistently high innate leaf N-wght compared to non-N-fixers. The ecological significance of the leaf nutrient attributes in this study is discussed by comparing the seedling data with those from field-collected material, and by brief reference to the natural habitats of the species.;;;;;;;;;98;2;90;0;101;0029-8549;;WOS:A1997XR38100003;

The objective was to investigate the sun-shade acclimation characteristics of this species. High-light grown plants (HL) had higher light saturated rates of photosynthesis than low-light plants (LL). No significant difference in dark respiration was observed between light regimes. Relative growth rate was initially (at 22 d) higher for HL, becoming similar between treatments in the last two harvests (44 and 66 d). Leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were higher for LL. Allocation of biomass to leaves was similar between treatments, while biomass allocated to roots was higher in HL. Allocation of biomass to stems was higher in LL. Leaves grown under high irradiance had less nitrogen per unit of mass and more per unit of area than leaves developed at low irradiance. These results suggest that light is important to the performance of this species and that the differential responses to light conditions may contribute to or detract from its ability to succeed in natural and agricultural environments or to endure control strategies.;;;;;;;;;8;0;6;13;18;0100-204X;;WOS:A1997XT66900004;

A fourth, non-chambered ambient treatment was included to assess chamber effects. Needles were used in 96 h feeding trials to determine the performance of young, second instar larvae of loblolly pine's principal leaf herbivore, red-headed pine sawfly, Neodiprion lecontei (Fitch). The relative consumption rate of larvae significantly increased on plants grown under elevated CO2, and needles grown in the highest CO2 regime were consumed 21% more rapidly than needles grown in ambient CO2. Both the significant decline in leaf nitrogen content and the substantial increase in leaf starch content contributed to a significant increase in the starch:nitrogen ratio in plants grown in elevated CO2. Insect consumption rate was negatively related to leaf nitrogen content and positively related to the starch:nitrogen ratio. Of the four volatile leaf monoterpenes measured, only beta-pinene exhibited a significant CO2 effect and declined in plants grown in elevated CO2. Although consumption changed, the relative growth rates of larvae were not different among CO2 treatments. Despite lower nitrogen consumption rates by larvae feeding on the plants grown in elevated CO2, nitrogen accumulation rates were the same for all treatments due to a significant increase in nitrogen utilization efficiency. The ability of this insect to respond at an early, potentially susceptible larval stage to poorer food quality and declining levels of a leaf monoterpene suggest that changes in needle quality within pines in future elevated-CO2 atmospheres may not especially affect young insects and that tree-feeding sawflies may respond in a manner similar to herb-feeding lepidopterans.;;;;;;;;;71;4;47;0;76;0029-8549;;WOS:A1994NR69600009;

Fifth-in-star larvae were fed these three diets for 23 days (20 May-12 June) in the laboratory. Instantaneous growth rate and gross growth efficiency were almost the same for larvae fed Potamogeton and Alnus, but lower for larvae fed Fagus. The larvae consumed 3 times more fresh Potamogeton than Alnus leaves, but the same amounts in terms of dry mass. The consumption of fresh Fagus was initially twice that of the two other food items but dropped rapidly during the experiment, following the marked seasonal decline of leaf nitrogen content. Allocation patterns of fat and protein differed among food sources. Larvae grown on Alnus accumulated more fat than larvae grown on Potamogeton, while the reverse was true for protein accumulation. The assimilation efficiency based on carbon units was the same (44%) for all three food items and was among the highest reported for shredding caddis larvae.

Narea;J;"REICH, PB; WALTERS, MB; ELLSWORTH, DS";;;;;;;;LEAF LIFE-SPAN IN RELATION TO LEAF, PLANT, AND STAND CHARACTERISTICS AMONG DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS;;;;;;;;ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS;;;;62;3;;;365;392;;10.2307/2937116;;;sept-92;1992;Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance. Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns.Among all species, both mass- (A(mass)) and area-based (A(area)) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.70) than an area (P < .05, r2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N(mass)) decreased (P < .001, r2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N(area)) did not (P > .25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A(mass) with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N(mass) and SLA on A(mass). Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, N(mass), and A(mass)) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A(mass) was a linear function of N(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A(area) was not significantly related to N(area). These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis.Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and A(mass)(r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A(mass) and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with A(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N(mass), SLA, LAR, and A(mass) interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals.These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P < .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A(mass), N(mass), and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaflife-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span.We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, SLA, leaf N(mass), A(mass), and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as causally interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.;;;;;;;;;807;62;763;7;900;d_c-15;;WOS:A1992JJ41600003;

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effect of increased N availability on growth and functional attributes of seedlings of five tree species with different life history characteristics under varying irradiances. The following questions have been addressed: (i) how do the pioneer and non-pioneer species respond in absolute growth and relative growth rate (RGR) to the interaction of light and nitrogen? (ii) how does the interaction between irradiance and nitrogen availability modulate growth attributes (i.e. functional attributes)? (iii) is there any variation in growth responses between leguminous and non-leguminous species along the light and nitrogen gradients?MethodsSeedlings of five tree species (Acacia catechu, Bridelia retusa, Dalbergia sissoo, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia arjuna) were subjected to twelve combinations of irradiance and N levels. Various growth traits, including height (HT), basal area (BA), whole plant dry biomass (M-D), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net assimilation rate (NAR), RGR, biomass fractions, root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) and leaf nitrogen content, were studied to analyse intra-and inter-specific responses to interacting light and N gradients.Important FindingsSignificant interactions for irradiance and N availability for majority of growth attributes indicates that growth and biomass allocation of seedlings were more responsive to N availability under high irradiance. However, species responded differentially to N addition and they did not follow successional status. Slow growers (B. retusa, a shade-tolerant species and L. parviflora, a light demander) exhibited greater response to N enrichment than the fast growers (A. catechu, D. sissoo and T. arjuna). However, N-mediated increment in growth traits was greater in non-legumes (B. retusa, L. parviflora and T. arjuna) compared with that of legumes (A. catechu and D. sissoo). Allocation of biomass to root was strongly suppressed at the highest N supply across species; however, at high irradiance and high N availability, a greater suppression in R: S ratio was observed for B. retusa. NAR was a stronger determinant of RGR relative to LAR, suggesting its prominent role in increased RGR along increasing irradiances. Overall, a higher growth response of slow-growing species to elevated N levels, particularly the non-pioneers (B. retusa and L. parviflora) suggests that future N deposition may lead to perturbations in competition hierarchies and species composition, ultimately affecting community dynamics in nutrient-poor tropical dry forests.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1752-9921;;WOS:000337063500005;

The ability to identify tree species that are efficient in balancing water loss and carbon uptake based on physiological traits associated with growth and water use is useful for screening candidate species and genotypes. We used a common-garden approach to evaluate the relationships between traits, productivity, and WUE among 21 tree species across two growing seasons. Species differed significantly in leaf-level gas exchange, Delta C-13, phenology and growth. Robinia pseudoacacia, Populus deltoides, Catalpa speciosa, Rhus copallinum, and Acer saccharinum had higher total height (Ht) and basal diameter (DB) growth than the other species. Delta C-13 scaled positively with growth rate and negatively with intrinsic WUE, suggesting that Delta C-13 could be an effective proxy for productivity and WUE for the species evaluated. Principle component analysis indicated that among the faster-growing species (high Ht and A(net)), Robinia pseudoacacia distinguished itself by a higher Delta C-13 and lower PNUE, while Populus deltoides, Rhus copallinum, Catalpa speciosa and Platanus occidentalis had a higher PNUE and lower Delta C-13, making it possible to select trees that could optimize the trade-off between carbon gain and water use and provide guidelines for policy making. Systematic measurements of gas exchange across the growing season are essential for validation of growth models and to elucidate the physiological basis for observed differences in productivity and WUE. Parameters such as A(net), SLA, N-mass, and Delta C-13 give very useful information for future breeding programs having goals of improving woody species productivity and WUE.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;2150-8925;;WOS:000327380900006;

The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (A (max), V (cmax), J (max)) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (K (L)) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (K (R)) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.";;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0912-3814;;WOS:000318569100016;

We test if the simulated NPP with inputs of observed leaf nitrogen concentration (N (mass)) and carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) explains altitudinal variations of ARW, relative growth rate (RGR), and maximum photosynthetic rate (P (max)) within a widespread woody species at moist timberline ecotones. We measured plant-level ARW and RGR, and related leaf traits (P (max), N (mass), delta C-13 etc.) for an alpine Rhododendron shrub (R. aganniphum var. schizopeplum) across ten altitudes (4,190-4,500 m) in the Sergyemla Mountains, southeast Tibet. Based on climate data available from Nyingchi station at 3,000 m, non-age-related ARW chronologies (1960-2008) for each of ten altitudes were positively correlated with June mean temperature, but related little with precipitation and other monthly mean temperatures. With increasing altitude, N (mass) and P (max) decreased and delta C-13 increased, resulting in decreases of observed RGR and simulated NPP. Current-year and recent 50-year-averaged ARWs were well correlated with observed RGR and P (max) and simulated NPP. June mean temperature explained > 62 % of the altitudinal variations in observed RGR and ARW as well as simulated NPP. At moist high altitudes, ARWs can be used as predictors of changes in NPP of alpine shrubs because the low temperature in the early growing season is the primary factor limiting both ARW and NPP.

Such an approach does not consider how patterns of nitrogen allocation may change with differences in light intensity, growing-season temperature and CO2 concentration. To account for this known variability in nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships, we develop a mechanistic nitrogen allocation model based on a trade-off of nitrogen allocated between growth and storage, and an optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The developed model is able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and radiation when evaluated against published data of V-c,V-max (maximum carboxylation rate) and J(max) (maximum electron transport rate). A sensitivity analysis of the model for herbaceous plants, deciduous and evergreen trees implies that elevated CO2 concentrations lead to lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation but higher allocation to storage. Higher growing-season temperatures cause lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation, due to higher nitrogen requirements for light capture pigments and for storage. Lower levels of radiation have a much stronger effect on allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation for herbaceous plants than for trees, resulting from higher nitrogen requirements for light capture for herbaceous plants. As far as we know, this is the first model of complete nitrogen allocation that simultaneously considers nitrogen allocation to light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, respiration and storage, and the responses of each to altered environmental conditions. We expect this model could potentially improve our confidence in simulations of carbon-nitrogen interactions and the vegetation feedbacks to climate in Earth system models.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;1932-6203;;WOS:000305335800084;22649564

Understanding ecological strategies of invasive species relative to the entire native community is important in understanding and managing both the mechanisms and the potential impacts of invasion, but few studies have taken this approach.2. We utilize advances in plant ecology to compare functional traits of an invasive shrub species, autumn-olive Elaeagnus umbellata, to those of the understorey native woody plant community in a southeast Michigan forest. We estimate species trait distributions for six leaf functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf laminar area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio and delta N-15) using a kernel estimator. We then use pairwise trait distance and overlaps to describe the ecological strategy of the invasive shrub relative to that of the native understorey woody plant community.3. The overlap of the invasive shrub's trait distribution with those of the native species was found to be smaller than the overlap of a native shrub's distribution with other native species, consistent with the empty niche hypothesis of invasion. However, the invasive species' mean leaf functional trait values typically fall outside of the range of most native species' mean trait values, suggesting the invasive shrub extends trait space for understorey individuals of the native woody plant community.4. The invasive shrub's leaf trait values are characteristic of a sun-demanding species, contradicting its presence in the shaded forest understorey community and its persistence in an empty niche. We propose that this novel use of leaf functional traits by the invasive shrub could indicate that the invasion is facilitated by additional mechanisms such as release from natural enemies, association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, use of an empty temporal niche (namely the light available to the understorey early in the growing season), bird dispersal or some synthesis of these factors.5. Synthesis and applications. This study develops plant functional trait theory by studying an invasive species within the context of the entire native woody plant community. The approach can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms of an invasion event and suggest ecological consequences and related management strategies for the maintenance of native forest communities. Specifically, this study, along with known data on the invasive species, suggests aggressive management in sunny gap and edge habitat provides the best strategy for long-term control.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;0021-8901;;WOS:000295095100005;

This study aimed to theoretically and experimentally demonstrate whether these observed L/R and N(area) are explained as optimal biomass allocation that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate (RGR). We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N(area) in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10% x nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N(area) is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N(area) of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums. From the model predictions and pot experiments, we conclude that the pioneer trees, M. bombycis and A. buergerianum, regulated L/R and N(area) to maximize RGR in response to nitrogen and light availability.;;;;;;;;;9;1;7;0;9;1932-6203;;WOS:000292699000033;21765957

However, this does not usually occur in other species, e.g., Ulmus pumila and Zizyphus jujuba. We compared stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) as indicators of leaf water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf area- and mass-based nitrogen content (N-area and N-mass) by tree height (1, 5, and 10 m) in P. hopeinsis, R. pseudoacacia, U. pumila, and Z jujuba. In P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, leaf delta C-13 and N-area were significantly lower in 10-m trees than in 1-m saplings, indicating that leaf WUE and photosynthetic rates of both species decreased with tree height. In contrast, delta C-13 in Z. jujuba varied little with tree height. The delta C-13 of 10-m-tall U. pumila trees was significantly higher than that of 1-m plants, demonstrating an increase in WUE with tree height. Decreasing WUE, leaf N-area and N-mass with height increases in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia may be related to water and nutrient limitations for these species in semiarid regions. in contrast, stable or increasing delta C-13 with tree height in U. pumila and Z jujuba may account (to some extent) for successful production of these species under identical environmental conditions. Diameter growth rate also decreased with maturity in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, but increased or was stable for U. pumila and Z. jujuba. The differences in leaf WUE and LMA among species with tree maturity may be related to species' growth patterns and susceptibility to drought stress, and are likely to be important new criteria for plantation species selection on the Loess Plateau.

In this article we show that this relationship is paradoxical because, if other traits are identical among species, plants with a higher A(mass) should have a lower N(mass), because of dilution by the assimilated carbon. To find a factor to overcome the dilution effect, we analyze the N(mass)-A(mass) relationship using simple mathematical models and literature data. We propose two equations derived from plant-growth models. Model prediction is compared with the data set of leaf trait spectrum obtained on a global scale. The model predicts that plants with a higher A(mass) should have a higher specific nitrogen absorption rate in roots (SAR), less biomass allocation to leaves, and/or greater nitrogen allocation to leaves. From the literature survey, SAR is suggested as the most likely factor. If SAR is the sole factor maintaining the positive relationship between N(mass) and A(mass), the variation in SAR is predicted to be much greater than that in A(mass); given that A(mass) varies 130-fold, SAR may vary more than 2000-fold.

The decreasing tree stature was attributed to a decrease in the asymptote of H in the D-0.1 (stem diameter at H/10)-H relationship toward the edge. The K. obovata trees were well classified into interior and edge types using a discriminant function based on the habitat-specific D-0.1-H relationships. Allometric equations, as a function of (D0.1H)-H-2, differed significantly between the interior and edge types in the estimation of the phytomasses of stems and leaves, and the leaf area per tree. On the other hand, common allometric equations were successfully established in the estimation of respective phytomasses of aboveground parts and branches. Biomass and leaf area index decreased toward the forest edge. The biomass allocation to stems decreased toward the edge, whereas those to branches and leaves increased. A dramatic change in stem diameter increment resulted in differences in the D-0.1-H relationship along the tree height gradient. Relative growth rate of biomass and light-saturated net photosynthesis, which paralleled net assimilation rate from the interior to the edge, showed their maximum peaks in the middle of the belt transect. This indicates that there exists an optimal environmental condition for growth of K. obovata trees.

The hypotheses were tested that the degree of branching (L(TB)) correlates with leaf traits and that height growth rate is negatively correlated with the degree of branching and leaf life span (LLS) by examining saplings of live canopy and subcanopy species, two shrub species and one invasive subshrub species (Clidemia hirta) in a tropical rain forest, West Java, Indonesia. Of the eight species, the most and least branched species were Castanopsis acuminatissima and Macaranga semiglobosa, respectively. Leaf traits examined were leaf size, LLS, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen concentration per mass (N(mass)) and per area. LLS tended to be positively correlated with LMA, and negatively correlated with N(mass). Leaf size was negatively correlated with LTB, but the other leaf traits were not correlated with L(TB). The height growth of the eight species was low, irrespective of L(TB) and LLS, for understorey individuals. The height growth of gap individuals was negatively correlated with LLS for the eight species, and also negatively with LTB for the seven species other than one subshrub species. Thus, the degree of branching was correlated with leaf size only among the five leaf traits, and both leaf life span and the degree of branching affected the height growth of gap individuals, except for the subshrub species.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0266-4674;;WOS:000258043300008;

Here we use data from 2021 species at 175 sites around the world from the GLOPNET compilation to show that key physiological traits that are difficult to measure (such as photosynthetic capacity) can be predicted from simple qualitative plant characteristics, climate information, easily measured (""soft"") leaf traits, or all of these in combination. The qualitative plant functional type (PFT) attributes examined are phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), growth form (grass, herb, shrub, or tree), and leaf phenology (deciduous vs. evergreen). These three PFT attributes explain between one-third and two-thirds of the variation in each of five quantitative leaf ecophysiological traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf life span, mass-based net photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)) nitrogen content (N-mass) and phosphorus content (P-mass). Alternatively, the combination of four simple, widely available climate metrics (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean vapor pressure deficit, and solar irradiance) explain only 5-20% of the variation in those same five leaf traits. Adding the climate metrics to the qualitative PFTs as independent factors in the model increases explanatory power by 3-11 % for the five traits. If a single easily measured leaf trait (SLA) is also included in the model along with qualitative plant traits and climate metrics, an additional 5-25% of the variation in the other four other leaf traits is explained, with the models accounting for 62%, 65%, 66%, and 73% of global variation in N-mass, P-mass, A(mass), and leaf life span, respectively. Given the wide availability of the summary climate data and qualitative PFT data used in these analyses, they could be used to explain roughly half of global variation in the less accessible leaf traits (A(mass), leaf life span, N-mass P-mass); this can be augmented to two-thirds of all variation if climatic and PFT data are used in combination with the readily measured trait SLA. This shows encouraging possibilities of progress in developing general predictive equations for macro-ecology, global scaling, and global modeling.";;;;;;;;;65;4;61;0;72;1051-0761;;WOS:000250142500011;17974336

In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR.

At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.;;;;;;;;;41;1;45;0;46;0028-646X;;WOS:000186322000006;

Most predation occurs on young, expanding leaves. Thus, a rapid growth of the leaves can reduce the impact of predation. Furthermore, in cold Mediterranean climates the length of the growing season is constrained to a short period in spring and early summer owing both to low winter temperatures and drought stress in early summer. Therefore, a rapid deployment of leaf area and a high photosynthetic capacity during the spring and early summer might have important positive effects on the final carbon balance of the leaf population. Relative growth rates (RGR) of leaf biomass were measured in 19 woody species typical of Central Western Spain with deciduous and evergreen habits. Highly significant differences were detected in the leaf growth rate of the different species. The differences between species, however, did not correlate either with the mean leaf life-span of each of the species or with other leaf traits such as photosynthetic capacity, specific leaf area or nitrogen content. Leaf growth rate was positively correlated with time elapsed between leaf initiation and fruit maturation, so that species with fruit dispersal in spring and early summer in general had lower leaf growth rates than species with autumn fruit shedding. This relationship shows the effects of the concurrence between vegetative and reproductive organs for nutrients and other resources. Nitrogen concentration in the leaves was very high at the time of bud break, and declined during leaf expansion owing to the dilution associated with the increase in structural components. The rate of nitrogen dilution was, thus, positively related to the leaf growth rate. Relative growth rates calculated for nitrogen mass in leaves were very low compared to the growth in total mass. This suggests that most leaf nitrogen is translocated from the plant stores to the leaf biomass before the start of leaf expansion and that the contribution of root uptake during leaf expansion is comparatively low.;;;;;;;;;24;0;22;0;27;1385-0237;;WOS:000183836200011;

The leaf traits analysed included density, thickness, saturated mass/dry mass, and leaf nitrogen per mass and per area. Other traits described the anatomy of leaves, most of them relating: to the lamina (proportions of palisade and spongy parenchymata, epidermis, air space and sclerified tissues, expressed as volume per leaf area, and per-cell transversal areas of epidermis and parenchymata), and another referring to the mid rib (transversal section of sclerified tissues). Across the whole set of species leaf mass per area was correlated with leaf density but not with thickness. and this was confirmed by taxonomic relatedness tests. Denser leaves corresponded with greater proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, smaller cells and lower water and N contents, but no relation was found with the proportion of air space in the lamina. Taxonomic relatedness analysis statistically supported the negative association of leaf density with saturated to dry leaf mass ratio. Thicker leaves also exhibited greater volume per leaf area and greater individual cell area in each of the tissues, particularly parenchyma. Mean leaf mass per area and leaf thickness were lower in deciduous than in evergreen species, but no significant differences in leaf density, proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina or cell area were found between the two groups. Leaf mass per area was higher in trees and subshrubs than in shrubs and climbers-plus-scramblers, this rank being equal for leaf density and proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, and reversed for cell area. Given the standardised environment and ontogenetic phase of the seedlings, we conclude that variation in leaf structure and anatomy among species and species groups has a strong genetic basis, and is already expressed early in the development of woody plants. From an ecological viewpoint, we can interpret greater leaf mass per area across this species set as greater allocation to support and defence functions, as shown predominantly by species from resource-poor environments.;;;;;;;;;99;25;93;4;128;0029-8549;;WOS:000089509700002;

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography.2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because A(max)/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and A(max)/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in A(max)/area, particularly in small saplings.3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species.4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. A(max)/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. A(max)/mass, PNUEmax and A(max)/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.;;;;;;;;;97;10;96;3;107;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500011;

However, it is not known whether such scaling if it exists, is similar among disparate biomes and plant functional types. We tested this idea by examining the interspecific relationships between R-d measured at a standard temperature and leaf life-span, N, SLA and A(max) for 69 species from four functional groups (forbs, broad-leafed trees and shrubs, and needle-leafed conifers) in six biomes traversing the Americas. alpine tundra/subalpine forest, Colorado; cold temperate forest/ grassland, Wisconsin; cool temperate forest, North Carolina; desert/shrubland, New Mexico; subtropical forest, South Carolina; and tropical rain forest, Amazonas, Venezuela. Area-based R-d was positively related to area-based leaf N within functional groups and for all species pooled, but not when comparing among species within any site. At all sites, mass-based R-d (Rd-mass) decreased sharply with increasing leaf life-span and was positively related to SLA and mass-based A(max) and leaf N (leaf N-mass). These intra-biome relationships were similar in shape and slope among sites, where in each case we compared species belonging to different plant functional groups. Significant Rd-mass-N-mass relationships were observed in all functional groups (pooled across sites), but the relationships differed, with higher R-d at any given leaf N in functional groups (such as forbs) with higher SLA and shorter leaf life-span. Regardless of biome or functional group, Rd-mass was well predicted by all combinations of leaf life-span, N-mass and/or SLA (r(2) > 0.79, P < 0.0001). At any given SLA, Rd-mass rises with increasing N-mass and/or decreasing leaf life-span and at any level of N-mass, Rd-mass rises with increasing SLA and/or decreasing leaf life-span. The relationships between R-d and leaf traits observed in this study support the idea of a global set of predictable interrelationships between key leaf morphological, chemical and metabolic traits.";;;;;;;;;235;47;212;2;288;0029-8549;;WOS:000073964200004;

For example, young expanding leaves in tree species may be less affected by enriched CO(2)-alterations in leaf phytochemistry than older mature leaves due to shorter exposure times to elevated CO(2) atmospheres. This, in turn, could result in different effects on early vs. late instar larvae of herbivorous insects. To address this, seedlings of white oak (Quercus alba L.), grown in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated CO(2), were fed to two important early spring feeding herbivores; gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.), and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner). Young, expanding leaves were presented to early instar larvae, and older fully expanded or mature leaves to late instar larvae. Young leaves had significantly lower leaf nitrogen content and significantly higher total nonstructural carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio as plant CO(2) concentration rose, while nonstructural carbohydrates and total carbon-based phenolics were unaffected by plant CO(2) treatment. These phytochemical changes contributed to a significant reduction in the growth rate of early instar gypsy moth larvae, while growth rates of forest tent caterpillar were unaffected. The differences in insect responses were attributed to an increase in the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of early instar forest tent caterpillar larvae feeding on elevated CO(2)-grown leaves, while early instar gypsy moth larval NUE remained unchanged among the treatments. Later instar larvae of both insect species experienced larger reductions in foliage quality on elevated CO(2)-grown leaves than earlier instars, as the carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves substantially increased. Despite this, neither insect species exhibited changes in growth or consumption rates between CO(2) treatments in the later instar. An increase in NUE was apparently responsible for offsetting reduced foliar nitrogen for the late instar larvae of both species.";;;;;;;;;46;15;39;0;62;1354-1013;;WOS:000072857700001;

The objective was to investigate the sun-shade acclimation characteristics of this species. High-light grown plants (HL) had higher light saturated rates of photosynthesis than low-light plants (LL). No significant difference in dark respiration was observed between light regimes. Relative growth rate was initially (at 22 d) higher for HL, becoming similar between treatments in the last two harvests (44 and 66 d). Leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were higher for LL. Allocation of biomass to leaves was similar between treatments, while biomass allocated to roots was higher in HL. Allocation of biomass to stems was higher in LL. Leaves grown under high irradiance had less nitrogen per unit of mass and more per unit of area than leaves developed at low irradiance. These results suggest that light is important to the performance of this species and that the differential responses to light conditions may contribute to or detract from its ability to succeed in natural and agricultural environments or to endure control strategies.;;;;;;;;;8;0;6;13;18;0100-204X;;WOS:A1997XT66900004;

A fourth, non-chambered ambient treatment was included to assess chamber effects. Needles were used in 96 h feeding trials to determine the performance of young, second instar larvae of loblolly pine's principal leaf herbivore, red-headed pine sawfly, Neodiprion lecontei (Fitch). The relative consumption rate of larvae significantly increased on plants grown under elevated CO2, and needles grown in the highest CO2 regime were consumed 21% more rapidly than needles grown in ambient CO2. Both the significant decline in leaf nitrogen content and the substantial increase in leaf starch content contributed to a significant increase in the starch:nitrogen ratio in plants grown in elevated CO2. Insect consumption rate was negatively related to leaf nitrogen content and positively related to the starch:nitrogen ratio. Of the four volatile leaf monoterpenes measured, only beta-pinene exhibited a significant CO2 effect and declined in plants grown in elevated CO2. Although consumption changed, the relative growth rates of larvae were not different among CO2 treatments. Despite lower nitrogen consumption rates by larvae feeding on the plants grown in elevated CO2, nitrogen accumulation rates were the same for all treatments due to a significant increase in nitrogen utilization efficiency. The ability of this insect to respond at an early, potentially susceptible larval stage to poorer food quality and declining levels of a leaf monoterpene suggest that changes in needle quality within pines in future elevated-CO2 atmospheres may not especially affect young insects and that tree-feeding sawflies may respond in a manner similar to herb-feeding lepidopterans.;;;;;;;;;71;4;47;0;76;0029-8549;;WOS:A1994NR69600009;

Fifth-in-star larvae were fed these three diets for 23 days (20 May-12 June) in the laboratory. Instantaneous growth rate and gross growth efficiency were almost the same for larvae fed Potamogeton and Alnus, but lower for larvae fed Fagus. The larvae consumed 3 times more fresh Potamogeton than Alnus leaves, but the same amounts in terms of dry mass. The consumption of fresh Fagus was initially twice that of the two other food items but dropped rapidly during the experiment, following the marked seasonal decline of leaf nitrogen content. Allocation patterns of fat and protein differed among food sources. Larvae grown on Alnus accumulated more fat than larvae grown on Potamogeton, while the reverse was true for protein accumulation. The assimilation efficiency based on carbon units was the same (44%) for all three food items and was among the highest reported for shredding caddis larvae. The study demonstrates that fresh tissue of Potamogeton perfoliatus provides a valuable food source to the facultative shredder herbivore Anabolia nervosa.;;;;;;;;;20;0;16;0;20;0029-8549;;WOS:A1994NH87700017;
Nmass;J;"REICH, PB; WALTERS, MB; ELLSWORTH, DS";;;;;;;;LEAF LIFE-SPAN IN RELATION TO LEAF, PLANT, AND STAND CHARACTERISTICS AMONG DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS;;;;;;;;ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS;;;;62;3;;;365;392;;10.2307/2937116;;;sept-92;1992;Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance. Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns.Among all species, both mass- (A(mass)) and area-based (A(area)) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.70) than an area (P < .05, r2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N(mass)) decreased (P < .001, r2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N(area)) did not (P > .25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A(mass) with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N(mass) and SLA on A(mass). Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, N(mass), and A(mass)) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A(mass) was a linear function of N(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A(area) was not significantly related to N(area). These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis.Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and A(mass)(r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A(mass) and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with A(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N(mass), SLA, LAR, and A(mass) interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals.These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P < .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A(mass), N(mass), and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaflife-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span.We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, SLA, leaf N(mass), A(mass), and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as causally interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.;;;;;;;;;807;62;763;7;900;d_c-15;;WOS:A1992JJ41600003;

In this study we attempt to identify mechanisms by which seedlings of dry tropical trees cope with water stress by adjusting their leaf characteristics to water availability and micro environments, and address following questions: How are leaf traits and relative growth rate (RGR) of the dominant seedling species of TDF affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture content (SMC)? What is the relationship of functional traits with each other? Can leaf traits singly or in combination predict the growth rate of seedling species of TDF? The study was conducted in situ on four sites (viz., Hathinala, Gaighat, Harnakachar and Ranitali, listed in order of decreasing SMC) within the tropical dry deciduous forest in northern India.Five leaf traits viz., specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), concentrations of leaf nitrogen (leaf N), phosphorus (leaf P) and chlorophyll (Chl) and two physiological processes, viz., stomatal conductance (Gs(net)) and photosynthetic rate (A(net)), and RGR, of four dominant tree seedling species of a TDF (viz., Buchanania lanzan, Diospyros melanoxylon, Shorea robusta and Terminalia tomentosa) on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed to predict RGR from mean values of SMC, leaf traits and physiological processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to observe the extent of intra- vs. inter-specific variability in the leaf traits and physiological rates.All the traits and physiological rates were interrelated and showed significant positive relationship with RGR except for the correlation of LDMC with RGR which was not significant. Further, relationships of SMC with all leaf traits, physiological rates and RGR were significant, except for that between SMC and SLA for B. lanzan and D. melanoxylon. The slope of seedling trait:SMC relationship, a measure of phenotypic plasticity in response to soil moisture gradient, varied among species. Among the four species, T. tomentosa was the most plastic and S. robusta the least.In conclusion, leaf traits and physiological processes were strongly related to soil water availability on the one hand and seedling growth on the other. Gs(net) is the most important variable which accounted for the greatest amount of variability (62%) in RGR, emphasizing the role of stomatal conductance in shaping growth patterns across spatial and temporal gradients of soil water availability. Gs(net) and SMC together explained 64% variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied by us are also important in modulating the growth of tropical tree seedlings.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1752-9921;;WOS:000316964200006;

Our results suggest that P (n) and R were highly skewed among the 39 species, ranging from 5 to 25 and 1 to 5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, while R/P (n) ratio was normally distributed at 0.1-0.3.

We also report the N, P, and C stoichiometry of 20 winterized tubers, which are the only perennial organs of this species. Comparisons between whole-plant and winterized N/C and P/C levels indicate that N was resorbed from aerial organs and stored in tubers by the end of the growing season. Leaves were substantial reservoirs for N and P. With few exceptions, N scaled isometrically with respect to C for each organ-type, whereas P scaled as the 3/4 power of C. Thus, N is proportional to P-3/4 which is proportional to C regardless of organ-type. Additionally, annual growth rate G of shoots (leaves and aerial stems) scaled as the -3 power of leaf N/P quotients such that G was proportional to the 3/4 power of leaf P. We suggest that these scaling relationships (together with previously reported allometric trends across herbaceous species) show that growth is constrained by organ-specific N and P allocation patterns (presumably to proteins and ribosomes. respectively).;;;;;;;;;11;5;10;1;17;f_vr-22;;WOS:000230882500005;21646146

A key factor in the growth response of trees to elevated [CO2] is the availability of nitrogen, although how elevated [CO2] influences the rate of N-2-fixation of nodulated trees growing under field conditions is unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we measured total biomass, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area and net photosynthetic rate of N-2-fixing Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (common alder) trees grown for 3 years in open-top chambers in the presence of either ambient or elevated atmospheric [CO2] and two soil N regimes: full nutrient solution or no fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation by Frankia spp. in the root nodules of unfertilized trees was assessed by the acetylene reduction method. We hypothesized that unfertilized trees would show similar positive growth and physiological responses to elevated [CO2] as the fertilized trees.Growth in elevated [CO2] stimulated (relative) net photosynthesis and (absolute) total biomass accumulation. Relative total biomass increased, and leaf nitrogen remained stable, only during the first year of the experiment. Toward the end of the experiment, signs of photosynthetic acclimation occurred, i.e., down-regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Relative growth rate was not significantly affected by elevated [CO2] because although NAR was increased, the effect on relative growth rate was negated by a reduction in leaf area ratio. Neither leaf area nor leaf P concentration was affected by growth in elevated [CO2].Nodule mass increased on roots of unfertilized trees exposed to elevated [CO2] compared with fertilized trees exposed to ambient [CO2]. There was also a biologically significant, although not statistically significant, stimulation of nitrogenase activity in nodules exposed to elevated [CO2]. Root nodules of trees exposed to elevated [CO2] were smaller and more evenly spaced than root nodules of trees exposed and [CO2] effects on growth, biomass and photosynthesis indicates that the unfertilized trees maintained similar CO2-induced growth and photosynthetic enhancements as the fertilized trees.

Benomyl fungicide was used to test this prediction in the field by limiting mycorrhizal colonization of 2-yr-old Valencia orange trees (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) on four rootstocks of varying mycorrhizal dependency in P-deficient soil fertilized with and without phosphate. No known fungal pathogens of citrus roots controlled by benomyl were present on the trees or in the field soil. Young trees with or without P fertilization and benomyl treatment remained sufficient in P (greater than or equal to 0.10% leaf P) throughout the 27-month study. Root zone drenches of benomyl reduced mycorrhizal colonization and leaf P status of Valencia orange trees on the three slower-growing rootstocks, trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.), Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi Macf. x P. trifoliata) and sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.), for the duration of three growing seasons. Benomyl affected root colonization and P status of trees on the faster-growing rootstock, Volkamer lemon (Citrus volkameriana Tan. and Pasq.), less than for trees on the slower-growing rootstocks and the effects were sustained for only two seasons. The shorter duration of benomyl effect for trees on Volkamer lemon rootstock compared with the slower-growing rootstocks was explained by the loss of inhibition of mycorrhizal activity when roots grew out of the drench zone and mycorrhizas were no longer in direct contact with the fungicide. Benomyl treatment increased growth rate of Valencia orange on the slow-growing rootstocks from 5 to 17 % after three seasons, and from 2 to 9 % on Volkamer lemon rootstock after two seasons compared with the non-benomyl treated trees. The benomyl effect was attributed to reduction of costs of root colonization over time, and consequently, a greater availability of carbon assimilate for shoot growth of trees. Since mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in fertilized agricultural soils and obligate biotrophs on the roots of most crop species, these results indicate a need to further investigate whether negative growth responses of P-sufficient plants in the field occur because mycorrhizal fungi are no longer behaving as mutualists.;;;;;;;;;59;0;58;1;61;0028-646X;;WOS:000076565000011;

In this study we attempt to identify mechanisms by which seedlings of dry tropical trees cope with water stress by adjusting their leaf characteristics to water availability and micro environments, and address following questions: How are leaf traits and relative growth rate (RGR) of the dominant seedling species of TDF affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture content (SMC)? What is the relationship of functional traits with each other? Can leaf traits singly or in combination predict the growth rate of seedling species of TDF? The study was conducted in situ on four sites (viz., Hathinala, Gaighat, Harnakachar and Ranitali, listed in order of decreasing SMC) within the tropical dry deciduous forest in northern India.Five leaf traits viz., specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), concentrations of leaf nitrogen (leaf N), phosphorus (leaf P) and chlorophyll (Chl) and two physiological processes, viz., stomatal conductance (Gs(net)) and photosynthetic rate (A(net)), and RGR, of four dominant tree seedling species of a TDF (viz., Buchanania lanzan, Diospyros melanoxylon, Shorea robusta and Terminalia tomentosa) on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed to predict RGR from mean values of SMC, leaf traits and physiological processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to observe the extent of intra- vs. inter-specific variability in the leaf traits and physiological rates.All the traits and physiological rates were interrelated and showed significant positive relationship with RGR except for the correlation of LDMC with RGR which was not significant. Further, relationships of SMC with all leaf traits, physiological rates and RGR were significant, except for that between SMC and SLA for B. lanzan and D. melanoxylon. The slope of seedling trait:SMC relationship, a measure of phenotypic plasticity in response to soil moisture gradient, varied among species. Among the four species, T. tomentosa was the most plastic and S. robusta the least.In conclusion, leaf traits and physiological processes were strongly related to soil water availability on the one hand and seedling growth on the other. Gs(net) is the most important variable which accounted for the greatest amount of variability (62%) in RGR, emphasizing the role of stomatal conductance in shaping growth patterns across spatial and temporal gradients of soil water availability. Gs(net) and SMC together explained 64% variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied by us are also important in modulating the growth of tropical tree seedlings.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1752-9921;;WOS:000316964200006;

Net photosynthesis (P (n)) and dark respiration (R) were measured at constant 25A degrees C under neither water nor nitrogen limited condition to assess whether the R/P (n) ratio was constant across different species and functional groups. Our results suggest that P (n) and R were highly skewed among the 39 species, ranging from 5 to 25 and 1 to 5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, while R/P (n) ratio was normally distributed at 0.1-0.3. Mean R/P (n) ratio was 0.19 for 39 species, and 0.20 and 0.18 for woody and herbs, respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups. Leaf P (n), R, and R/P (n) ratios exhibited large variations across 39 species while R/P (n) ratio in our subtropical species was considerably higher than other studies. Our results also indicated that the difference within each group was even larger than between the two groups. Based on the pooled data set at global scale, and considering R/P (n) ratios performance under a combination of wet and warm conditions, the mean R/P (n) ratio of 0.19 fell between the R/P (n) ratio of 0.23 under dry and warm conditions and the R/P (n) ratio of 0.07 under cold regardless of the precipitation conditions. The comparison with published data sets indicated significant effects of long-term precipitation and temperature on leaf R/P (n) ratios at global scale, and we found that the plants adapting to warm and wet climates including our thirty-nine species tend to have a lower R/P (n) ratio.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;0931-1890;;WOS:000288393700014;

We also report the N, P, and C stoichiometry of 20 winterized tubers, which are the only perennial organs of this species. Comparisons between whole-plant and winterized N/C and P/C levels indicate that N was resorbed from aerial organs and stored in tubers by the end of the growing season. Leaves were substantial reservoirs for N and P. With few exceptions, N scaled isometrically with respect to C for each organ-type, whereas P scaled as the 3/4 power of C. Thus, N is proportional to P-3/4 which is proportional to C regardless of organ-type. Additionally, annual growth rate G of shoots (leaves and aerial stems) scaled as the -3 power of leaf N/P quotients such that G was proportional to the 3/4 power of leaf P. We suggest that these scaling relationships (together with previously reported allometric trends across herbaceous species) show that growth is constrained by organ-specific N and P allocation patterns (presumably to proteins and ribosomes. respectively).;;;;;;;;;11;5;10;1;17;f_vr-22;;WOS:000230882500005;21646146

We found a significant positive relationship between seed mass and time to seedling emergence (P < 0.001) and a strong negative relationship between seed mass and time between emergence and production of the first true leaf (P < 0.001). Surprisingly, we found no relationship between seed mass and seedling establishment (P = 0.21). It seems most likely that this lack of relationship is a result of the many stochastic factors affecting seedling establishment during any given recruitment episode at any given site. A cause of mortality was assigned to 56% of the 781 seedlings that died during the present study. There was no relationship between cause of death and seed mass (P = 0.28).

A key factor in the growth response of trees to elevated [CO2] is the availability of nitrogen, although how elevated [CO2] influences the rate of N-2-fixation of nodulated trees growing under field conditions is unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we measured total biomass, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area and net photosynthetic rate of N-2-fixing Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (common alder) trees grown for 3 years in open-top chambers in the presence of either ambient or elevated atmospheric [CO2] and two soil N regimes: full nutrient solution or no fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation by Frankia spp. in the root nodules of unfertilized trees was assessed by the acetylene reduction method. We hypothesized that unfertilized trees would show similar positive growth and physiological responses to elevated [CO2] as the fertilized trees.Growth in elevated [CO2] stimulated (relative) net photosynthesis and (absolute) total biomass accumulation. Relative total biomass increased, and leaf nitrogen remained stable, only during the first year of the experiment. Toward the end of the experiment, signs of photosynthetic acclimation occurred, i.e., down-regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Relative growth rate was not significantly affected by elevated [CO2] because although NAR was increased, the effect on relative growth rate was negated by a reduction in leaf area ratio. Neither leaf area nor leaf P concentration was affected by growth in elevated [CO2].Nodule mass increased on roots of unfertilized trees exposed to elevated [CO2] compared with fertilized trees exposed to ambient [CO2]. There was also a biologically significant, although not statistically significant, stimulation of nitrogenase activity in nodules exposed to elevated [CO2].

One specific expression of this general idea is the hypothesis that tree species sorting on temperature gradients in temperate regions involves a trade-off between growth rate and frost resistance, because adaptations to frost reduce light interception and carbon gain potential. We measured seedling growth of 17 New Zealand rain forest angiosperm trees in a glasshouse, as well as biomass partitioning, gas exchange and hydraulic traits. We then related these variables to the mean July (winter) minimum temperatures most frequently experienced throughout the range of each species. Species associated with mild winters on average had wider vessels and more conductive stems and were leafier (i.e. developed more foliage area per unit sapwood area) than species from frostier sites. Species' positions on the temperature gradient were not significantly correlated with relative growth rates of seedlings; they were, however, negatively correlated with two measures of species light requirements in the field: the light compensation point for growth, and low-light mortality rates obtained from the literature.Synthesis. Although seedling growth rates of warm- and cool-temperate New Zealand angiosperm trees were similar on average, the former are more shade tolerant. Competitive hierarchies associated with tree species sorting on temperature gradients thus probably involve a shift in the relationship between shade tolerance and growth rate, rather than a simple trade-off of growth with cold tolerance. This shift is associated with variation in light interception potential per unit of seedling biomass, possibly reflecting a trade-off between stem conductivity and resistance to freeze-thaw embolism.";;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0022-0477;;WOS:000325984300016;

The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (A (max), V (cmax), J (max)) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (K (L)) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (K (R)) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.";;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0912-3814;;WOS:000318569100016;

The variation in anatomical and hydraulic characteristics of branches was considered from three perspectives: vertically within a crown (lower, middle and upper crown), radially along main branches (proximal, middle and distal part), and with respect to branch orders (first-, second- and third-order branches). Hydraulically weighted mean diameter of vessels (D (h)) and theoretical specific conductivity of the xylem (k (t)) exhibited no vertical trend within the tree crown, whereas leaf-specific conductivity of the xylem (LSCt) decreased acropetally. Variation in LSCt was governed by sapwood area to leaf area ratio (Huber value) rather than by changes in xylem anatomy. The acropetal increase in soil-to-leaf conductance (G (T)) within the birch canopy is attributable to longer path length within the lower-crown branches and higher hydraulic resistance of the shade leaves. D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, while vessel density (VD) and relative area of vessel lumina (VA) increased distally along main branches. A strong negative relationship between vessel diameter and VD implies a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability of xylem. D (h) and VD combined explained 85.4% of the total variation of k (t) in the regression model applied to the whole data set. Xylem in fast-growing branches (primary branches) had greater area of vessel lumina per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood, resulting in a positive relationship between branch radial growth rate and k (t). D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, whereas VD increased with increasing branch order. This pattern promotes the hydraulic dominance of primary branches over the secondary branches and their dominance over tertiary branches. In this way crown architecture contributes to preferential water flow along the main axes, potentially providing better water supply for the branch apical bud and foliage located in the outer, better-insolated part of the crown.;;;;;;;;;14;1;12;0;15;0931-1890;;WOS:000254240300009;

Acer negundo is a ruderal tree, A. saccharinum, and A. rubrum are fast-growing and shade-intolerant soft maples, whereas A. nigrum and A. saccharum are slow-growing and shade-tolerant hard maples. It was hypothesized that the ruderal and soft maples would have lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), but higher maximum specific conductivity (K-s max) than hard maples. Many anatomical and general morphological characteristics were measured in an attempt to correlate them to water transport and/or mechanical strength differences between species. No difference was found between species in vessel diameter, fiber wall thickness, initial hydraulic conductivity (K-h initial), specific conductivity (K-s max), native percent embolism, or Huber value. Similarly, no trade-off was found between K-s max and MOE or MOR across the genus. However, fiber lumen diameter was inversely correlated to MOE and MOR. Surprisingly, percentage of ray parenchyma was positively related to MOE. The results suggest transport/mechanical trade-offs do not occur in Acer and differences in mechanical properties may be due to fiber lumen differences that do not influence the efficient transport of water.;;;;;;;;;26;0;27;0;28;f_vr-22;;WOS:000183133400004;21659164

This study examines selective pressures exerted during post-dispersal seed predation and germination on the subindividual variation of seed size in hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). With a seed offering experiment and a germination test, we estimated phenotypic selection differentials for average and subindividual variation of seed size due to seed predation and germination. Seed size affects germination, growth rate and the probability of an individual seed of escaping predation. Longer seeds showed higher germination rates, but this did not result in significant selection on phenotypes of the maternal trees. On the other hand, seed predators avoided wider seeds, and by doing so exerted phenotypic selection on adult average and subindividual variation of seed size. The detected selection on subindividual variation suggests that the levels of phenotypic variation within individual plants may be, at least partly, the adaptive consequence of animal-mediated selection.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1435-8603;;WOS:000337613000018;24176051

For example, Prosopis velutina has proliferated in many grasslands of the Sonoran Desert in North America over the past century, while other shrub species with similar growth form and life history, such as Acacia greggii, have not. We conducted a glasshouse experiment to assess whether differences in early seedling development could help explain why one species and not the other came to dominate many Sonoran Desert grasslands. We established eight watering treatments mimicking a range of natural precipitation patterns and harvested seedlings 16 or 17 days after germination. A. greggii had nearly 7 times more seed mass than P. velutina, but P. velutina emerged earlier (by 3.0 +/- 0.3 d) and grew faster (by 8.7 +/- 0.5 mg d(-1)). Shoot mass at harvest was higher in A. greggii (99 +/- 6 mg seedling(-1)) than in P. velutina (74 +/- 2 mg seedling(-1)), but there was no significant difference in root mass (54 +/- 3 and 49 +/- 2 mg seedling(-1), respectively). Taproot elongation was differentially sensitive to water supply: under the highest initial watering pulse, taproots were 52 +/- 19 mm longer in P. velutina than in A. greggii. Enhanced taproot elongation under favorable rainfall conditions could give nascent P. velutina seedlings growth and survivorship advantages by helping reduce competition with grasses and maintain contact with soil water during drought. Conversely, A. greggii's greater investment in mass per seed appeared to provide little return in early seedling growth. We suggest that such differences in recruitment traits and their sensitivities to environmental conditions may help explain ecological differences between species that are highly similar as adults and help identify pivotal drivers of shrub encroachment into grasslands.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1932-6203;;WOS:000330507300161;24475263

An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.;;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;5;0027-8424;;WOS:000329614500046;24379395

The survival/growth rates, nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations and pools in each plant organ of the two species seedlings were monitored in two consecutive years. The survival rate and relative growth rate (RGR) of both species peaked at the 100% light level. No seedlings of both species survived at the 1% light level. The NSC concentration varied insignificantly with light levels in the roots of 12 mongolica and the stems of both species in 2010, while the NSC concentration and pool decreased with light reduction for both species in 2011. With a light level decrease from 20% to 5%, Q mongolica showed insignificant differences, but P. koraiensis exhibited a significant decrease in survival rate and NSC levels. The survival rates of P. koraiensis and Q mongolica seedlings were positively and significantly related to the NSC concentration in leaves (r(1) = 0.9898) and NSC concentration in roots (r(2) = 0.9976), respectively. These results suggested that: (1) full sunlight was the optimum light environment for the initial survival and growth of both tree species; (2) low light induced carbohydrate deficiency, which might be the key factor resulting in seedling mortality in forest understory; (3) different NSC allocation patterns in response to light alteration might promote the coexistence of P. koraiensis and Q. mongolica in the early stage of regeneration in the forest stands.

Suites of correlated functional traits may reflect fundamental tradeoffs and general plant strategies and hence represent trait spectra along which plant species can vary according to their respective strategies. However, the functional interpretation of these trait spectra requires the inspection of their relation to plant performance. We employed principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) to quantify fundamental whole-plant trait spectra based on 23 traits for 305 North American woody species that span boreal to subtropical climates. We related the major axes of PCoA to five measures of plant performance (i.e., growth rate, and tolerance to drought, shade, water-logging and fire) for all species and separately for gymnosperms and angiosperms. Across all species a unified gymnosperm-angiosperm trait spectrum (wood density, seed mass, rooting habit) is identified, which is correlated with drought tolerance. Apart from this, leaf type and specific leaf area (SLA) strongly separate gymnosperms from angiosperms. For gymnosperms, one trait spectrum emerges (seed mass, rooting habit), which is positively correlated with drought tolerance and inversely with shade tolerance, reflecting a tradeoff between these two strategies due to opposing trait characteristics. Angiosperms are functionally more diverse. The trait spectra related to drought tolerance and shade tolerance are decoupled and three distinct strategies emerge: high drought tolerance (low SLA, dense wood, heavy seeds, taproot), high shade tolerance (high SLA, shallow roots, high toxicity, opposite arranged leaves), and fast growth/stress intolerance (large maximum heights, soft wood, light seeds, high seed spread rate). In summary, our approach reveals that complex suits of traits and potential tradeoffs underlie fundamental performance strategies in forests. Studies relying on small sets of plant traits may not be able to reveal such underlying strategies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;2150-8925;;WOS:000327380400011;

Female-biased sex ratios are relatively rare in dioecious plants, and are not easily explained by costs of reproduction, which are often higher in females. In fact, data from reproductive adults in this population showed modular growth favoring males, which led to questions concerning the source of female-bias. Using seeds collected from 20 maternal plants in 1992, a garden study was conducted from 1993-2003 in which periodic flowering censuses were conducted, and plant size parameters were recorded. The plants were grown in a relatively tightly packed array which likely forced early intraspecific competition. The results suggested that L. benzoin females may compensate for differential costs of reproduction via larger initial seed size and early growth rate, but that sexual dimorphism in such a highly competitive scenario can favor males even more dramatically than in typical field conditions. Despite larger early size and faster growth in female seedlings, males showed clear advantages over females in the post-reproductive period and mortality was much higher in female genets. Sex ratios were close to the same level of female bias seen in the wild population around the time of initial flowering, but trended toward maleness as post-reproductive stage genet mortality ensued. Explanations for the development and persistence of female bias include larger seedling size that may give females a competitive advantage over males in the prereproductive stage, which under certain circumstances may lead to greater survival of female seedlings. Variation among habitats in herbivory and other environmental factors that influence survival and sex expression could ameliorate the competitive advantage of males associated with their lower reproductive costs.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1095-5674;;WOS:000339655700006;

Here, we used a powerful sample size and a strong quantitative genetic approach to analyse the sources of variation of early seedling performance and to identify seed mass (SM)-dependent and -independent maternal environmental effects in Maritime pine. We measured SM of 8924 individual seeds collected from 10 genotypes clonally replicated in two environments of contrasting quality (favourable and stressful), and we measured seedling growth rate and biomass allocation to roots and shoots. SM was extremely variable (up to 14-fold) and strongly determined by the maternal environment and the genotype of the mother tree. The favourable maternal environment led to larger cones, larger seeds and reduced SM variability. The maternal environment also determined the offspring phenotype, with seedlings coming from the favourable environment being 35% larger and with greater root/shoot ratio. Transgenerational plasticity appears, thus, to be a relevant source of phenotypic variation in the early performance of this pine species. Seed provisioning explained most of the effect of the maternal environment on seedling total biomass. Environmental maternal effects on seedling biomass allocation were, however, determined through SM-independent mechanisms, suggesting that other epigenetic regulation channels may be involved.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0018-067X;;WOS:000323209400009;23652562

We evaluate the growth and survival of 24 tree species used for forest restoration in pastures in the wet tropics in Mexico for 42 months. We relate their performance to 13 underlying functional traits that are important for leaf display, tree architecture and reproduction. Pioneers realized both faster growth rates and higher survival than non-pioneer species. No consistent ontogenetic cross-overs in species growth and survival were found during 42 months, which implies that species performance early after planting (12 months) predicted performance well after 42 months, probably because environmental conditions changed little over time in these early-successional pastures. Nine out of 12 functional traits were good predictors of growth rates and/or survival measures across all 24 species or for pioneer or non-pioneer species separately. Growth rates and survival were positively related to crown size and negatively to seed mass, but they were - surprisingly - not related to the leaf traits we measured. Multivariate plant trait axes explained species growth rates and survival better than individual traits only for the non-pioneer species group. Selection of additional traits may be needed for better predictions of overall performance of restoration plantings. Combining the basic science of functional ecology with the applied goals of forest management and restoration allow us to select the best mid-term performing tree species for planting in pastures using a short-term screening of growth and survival rates. Pioneers and non-pioneer species with small seeds and large crown length are good candidates for plantings in pastures since they have the best mid-term performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This difference in growth rate is thought to reflect systematic variation in physiology, allocation and leaf construction. Previous studies documenting this effect have, however, ignored differences in seed mass. As woody species often have larger seeds and RGR is negatively correlated with seed mass, it is entirely possible the lower RGRs observed in woody species is a consequence of having larger seeds rather than different growth strategies. Using a synthesis of the published literature, we explored the relationship between RGR and growth form, accounting for the effects of seed mass and study-specific effects (e. g. duration of study and pot volume), using a mixed-effects model. The model showed that herbaceous species do indeed have higher RGRs than woody species, and that the difference was independent of seed mass, thus at all seed masses, herbaceous species on average grow faster than woody ones.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0962-8452;;WOS:000319385100021;23677351

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of similar to 130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.;;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;d_c-58;;WOS:000312892500013;23431593

Genome size was therefore used as a proxy for them in order to assess how common plant traits such as height, specific leaf area and seed size/number predict species regional abundance. In this study it is hypothesized that if there is residual correlation between genome size and abundance after these traits are partialled out, there must be additional ecological effects of cell size and/or cell-division rate.Methods Variation in genome size, plant traits and regional abundance were examined in 436 herbaceous species of central European flora, and relationships were sought for among these variables by correlation and path analysis.Key Results Species regional abundance was weakly but significantly correlated with genome size; the relationship was stronger for annuals (R-2 = 0145) than for perennials (R-2 = 0027). In annuals, genome size was linked to abundance via its effect on seed size, which constrains seed number and hence population growth rate. In perennials, it weakly affected (via height and specific leaf area) competitive ability. These relationships did not change qualitatively after phylogenetic correction. In both annuals and perennials there was an unresolved effect of genome size on abundance.Conclusions The findings indicate that additional predictors of regional abundance should be sought among variables that are linked to cell size and cell-division rate. Signals of these cell-level processes remain identifiable even at the landscape scale, and show deep differences between perennials and annuals. Plant population biology could thus possibly benefit from more systematic use of indicators of cell-level processes.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0305-7364;;WOS:000310892900002;22628380

Seedlings were grown and evaluated in a common garden test at Bamako, Mali. Germination was assessed and growth measured 3 and 12 months after germination. Leaf morphology (leaf length, leaflet number, petiole length and diameter and leaflet border) were assessed after 12 months. Significant differences between the provenances were observed for both growth rate and leaf morphology. West African provenances in general grew faster than East African provenances, but leaf characters did not reveal a particular geographic structure, and the correlations between geographic distances and multivariate Mahalanobis distances were not significant. The correlations between leaf morphological traits and climatic data were in general low at the provenance level. However, the number of leaflets was significantly higher for provenances from drier areas. Two years increment at a field site also varied significantly between the provenances, where West African provenances confirmed their tendency to higher growth rate. Still, trees are young and results regarding both growth data and leaf characteristics should be confirmed when the trees are closer to maturity.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0167-4366;;WOS:000306585800016;

A system to predict which tree species are likely to be suitable for direct seeding would therefore be useful for improving forest restoration projects. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of seed traits on the success of direct seeding to restore tropical forest in southern Thailand. Seeds of 19 indigenous lowland tropical forest tree species were collected, from both the east and west sides of the Thailand peninsular and the following parameters measured: seed size, shape, coat thickness and moisture content. Field trials were established to determine seed germination rates and to calculate a ""direct seeding suitability score"" for each species, which combined seedling establishment and growth rates. Seed size, shape and moisture content were associated with germination percentage. Species with higher seedling survival tended to have large or intermediate-sized seeds, round or oval seeds and seeds with low or medium moisture content. Only seed coat thickness was significantly correlated with the suitability score (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Seed coat thickness > 0.4 mm coincided with higher rank suitability score.

Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar.2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types.3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 x 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 x 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35% for seed mass to 77% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity.4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.";;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200007;

Functional traits are posited to explain interspecific differences in performance, but these relationships are difficult to describe for long-lived organisms such as trees, which exhibit strong ontogenetic changes in demographic rates. Here, we use a size-dependent model of tree growth to test the extent to which of 17 functional traits related to leaf and stem economics, adult stature and seed size predict the ontogenetic trajectory of tree growth.2. We used a Bayesian modelling framework to parameterize and contrast three size-dependent diameter growth models using 16 years of census data from 5524 individuals of 50 rain forest tree species: a size-dependent model, a size-dependent model with species-specific parameters and a size-dependent model based on functional traits.3. Most species showed clear hump-shaped ontogenetic growth trajectories and, across species, maximum growth rate varied nearly tenfold, from 0.58 to 5.51 mm year(-1). Most species attained their maximum growth at 60% of their maximum size, whereas the magnitude of ontogenetic changes in growth rate varied widely among species.4. The Trait-Model provided the best compromise between explained variance and model parsimony and needed considerably fewer parameters than the model with species terms.5. Stem economics and adult stature largely explained interspecific differences in growth strategy. Maximum absolute diameter growth rates increased with increasing adult stature and leaf delta(13)C and decreased with increasing wood density. Species with light wood had the greatest potential to modulate their growth, resulting in hump-shaped ontogenetic growth curves. Seed size and leaf economics, generally thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance, had no significant relationships with the growth parameters.6. Synthesis. Our modelling approach offers a promising way to link demographic parameters to their functional determinants and hence to predict growth trajectories in species-rich communities with little parameter inflation, bridging the gap between functional ecology and population demography.;;;;;;;;;24;0;24;0;24;0022-0477;;WOS:000296425000014;

Simultaneously, seedlings of all species lost many more leaves at nests than in the forest understorey, causing a negative net leaf gain. Net leaf gain in the shaded understorey ranged from zero (Licania and Thyrsodium species) to substantial growth for Copaifera and Virola, and intermediate levels little above zero for Protium and Pouteria. Also seedling survival differed across habitats and species, being typically low in the centre and at the edge of nests where seedlings were often completely defoliated by the ants. Lastly, seedling survival increased strongly with seed size at nest edges while there was no such correlation in the forest. Our results suggest that Atta nests operate as ecological filters by creating a specific disturbance regime that differs from other disturbances in tropical forests. Apparently, Atta nests favour large-seeded tree species with resprouting abilities and the potential to profit from a moderate, nestmediated increase in light availability.;;;;;;;;;6;1;6;0;6;1442-9985;;WOS:000296325300004;

Despite our growing knowledge on the role of functional traits in structuring plant communities, few studies have tested their importance at large scales in the wet tropics. Here, we describe the distribution patterns of the most important West African rain forest timber species along the regional rainfall gradient and relate them to their functional traits. We found that the distribution patterns of 25 out of the 31 studied species (80%) were significantly related to mean annual rainfall. Shade tolerance and drought resistance were identified as the main strategy axes of variation. Wood density and leaf deciduousness emerged as the best predictor traits of species position along the rainfall gradient, explaining respectively 32 and 15 percent of the variation. Species traits tended to show stronger relationships with estimated optimum annual rainfall for each species than to the extreme rainfall conditions where they occur. The significant role of rainfall in shaping timber species distribution and the strong relationships between species traits and rainfall indicate that changes in climate, especially declining rainfall, could have strong effects on species composition and abundance in these tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;15;1;14;0;16;juin-06;;WOS:000294560000006;

These data were used to test whether genome size was significantly different for invasive (n = 21; species known to be established and spreading in foreign environments) and non-invasive (n = 71; species that have been introduced to foreign environments but which are not known to be spreading) species. Data for five functional traits [seed mass, specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum height and dispersal mode] and three characteristics of native range (size, temperature range and precipitation range) were used to test for univariate and multivariate relationships between (1) invasiveness and traits and (2) genome size and traits.Results Genome size ranged from 1.20 to 2.13 pg/2C and was not significantly smaller in invasive compared with non-invasive acacias. However, invasive acacias were found to be taller and possess a larger native range size and a wider range of annual precipitation when compared with non-invasive acacias. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between invasive and non-invasive acacias (PERMANOVA; P < 0.01) driven largely by differences in native range characteristics. We detected a positive relationship between genome size and SLA (P = 0.02) and elaiosome dispersal mode (P < 0.01) in analyses across species, but these findings were not supported by evolutionary divergence analyses.Main conclusions Genome size variation does not underpin variation in traits associated with the invasive/non-invasive dichotomy in introduced acacias, probably because of the very small DNA values in the Acacia species studied. Acacias introduced into new environments are most likely to become invasive if they are tall shrubs or trees and are widely distributed in their native range.";;;;;;;;;18;0;18;0;18;1366-9516;;WOS:000294655400009;

However, the ecological responses arising from changes in land use such as traditional and modified shifting cultivation practices are less well known. The distribution and dynamics of plant populations may be affected by such changes in land use and often their responses are compounded by a lack of life history data. The life history traits and demographic parameters important to successional species responses to disturbance remain poorly understood beyond broad generalisations, particularly in rainforests outside of the Neotropics. We examined the life history and demography of five rainforest tree species in Papua New Guinea to investigate the effect of shifting cultivation practices on their population dynamics. The demographic parameters most successful for continued population growth were medium to high recruitment, low seedling mortality and high seedling abundance, relatively low growth rates (compared to many pioneer species) and moderate to high abundance in all life stages. Successful life history traits were high seed mass, moderate shade-tolerance and high cultural value. In accordance with their demographies and life histories, Pterocarpus indicus, Vitex colossus and Artocarpus altilis were classified as early successional species, while Pometia pinnata and Canarium indicum were considered mid-successional. The results suggest that the earlier successional species do not necessarily have an advantage in disturbed environments; persistence is more likely to rely on the response of inherent demographic processes to external influences.

Trees are scarce in these environments but some manage to survive, such as the tree Moringa peregrina. Understanding how trees maintain viable populations in extremely arid environments may provide insight into the adaptive mechanisms by which trees cope with extremely arid weather conditions. This understanding is relevant to the current increasing aridity in several regions of the world.Methods : Seed germination experiments were conducted to assess variation in seed mass, seed germination, and seedling traits of Moringa peregrina plants and the correlations among these traits. A seed burial experiment was also designed to study the fate of M. peregrina seeds buried at two depths in the soil for two time periods.Key results : On average, seeds germinated in three days and seedling shoots grew 0.7 cm per day over three weeks. Larger seeds decreased germination time and increased seedling growth rates relative to smaller seeds. Seeds remained quiescent in the soil and germination was very high at both depths and burial times.Conclusions : The after-ripening time of Moringa peregrina seeds is short and seeds germinate quickly after imbibition. Plants of M. peregrina may increase in hyper-arid environments from seeds with larger mass, shorter germination times, and faster seedling growth rates. The results also illustrate the adjustment in allocation to seed biomass and correlations among seed and seedling traits that allows M. peregrina to be successful in coping with aridity in its environment.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;f_vr-22;;WOS:000291395600021;21653511

The seed mass and composition of seed reserves of 19 co-existing tree species were studied, and we examined how they varied among species in relation to germination and seedling growth rates, as well as between two years with contrasting precipitation (652 and 384 mm).Methods Seeds were collected from a tropical deciduous forest in the northwest of Mexico (Chamela Biological Station). The seed dry mass, with and without the seed coat, and the concentrations of lipids, nitrogen and nonstructural carbohydrates for the seed minus seed coat were determined. The anatomical localization of these reserves was examined using histochemical analysis. The germination capacity, rate and lag time were determined. The correlations among these variables, and their relationship to previously reported seedling relative growth rates, were evaluated with and without phylogenetic consideration.Key Results There were interannual differences in seed mass and reserve composition. Seed was significantly heavier after the drier year in five species. Nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with seed coat fraction, and was significantly higher after the drier year in 12 species. The rate and lag time of germination were negatively correlated with each other. These trait correlations were also supported for phylogenetic independent contrasts. Principal component analysis supported these correlations, and indicated a negative association of seedling relative growth rate with seed size, and a positive association of germination rate with nitrogen and lipid concentrations.Conclusions Nitrogen concentration tended to be higher after the drier year and, while interannual variations in seed size and reserve composition were not sufficient to affect interspecific correlations among seed and seedling traits, some of the reserves were related to germination variables and seedling relative growth rate.;;;;;;;;;9;1;8;2;11;0305-7364;;WOS:000289838700005;21385781

The time during which these reserves are used may vary within species, depending on the availability of external resources. We have investigated the duration of use of the seed reserves in the large-seeded tree species Araucaria angustifolia, when growing under different light and nutrient availabilities. We hypothesised that this duration would not vary with growing conditions, because of the high pressure exerted by predators on these seeds and because of the existing possibility of transferring to and restoring part of their starchy reserves in the underground hypocotyl. Plant growth took place for 139 days under shade cloth in outside gardens, under each of the four combinations of high and low light or nutrient availabilities. Plants within each treatment were separated into six different groups, each including seedlings which were separated from their seeds by cotyledon excision at five different time periods after seed sowing (43, 63, 83, 103 and 124 days), plus a Control group of seedlings which were not deprived from their seeds. Final mass accumulation by seedlings that had full access to the seed reserves was compared with that of seedlings which were separated from their seeds at different time periods after seed sowing. Seed mass evaluations at each excision period allowed us to follow the temporal pattern of seed consumption. We found that seedlings growing under low light used seed reserves for growth longer than those under high light, regardless of their nutrient condition, pointing to the importance of a large seed for seedling establishment under deep shade. However, seed consumption followed a very similar pattern in both light treatments. Nutrient availability did not affect the duration of growth dependency on seed reserves or the pace of seed mass depletion. Our initial hypothesis was then accepted, and the possible implications of the reported early growth behaviour of the species in coping with seed predation and shading are discussed.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0067-1924;;WOS:000287201400005;

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.7. Synthesis. Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000282978100020;

Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;14;0;14;0;14;0021-8901;;WOS:000279405100012;

How do oak species respond along gradients of these factors?LocationMediterranean oak forest in southern Spain.MethodsWe analysed seedling growth components and morphology of three co-occurring Quercus species (two deciduous and one evergreen). Oak seeds with a wide variety of sizes were sown along broad gradients of abiotic conditions. Intra- and inter-specific differences were evaluated by calibrating maximum likelihood estimators of seedling growth during the first two years of life.ResultsWe found multiple resources and conditions affecting seedling morphology and biomass allocation. However, the integrative variables of seedling growth - total aboveground biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) - were affected by two main factors: seed mass and light conditions. The relative contribution of these two factors depended strongly on seedling age. Seed mass explained most of the growth and morphological variables during the first year, while light conditions were the best predictor in the second growing season. In contrast, soil factors did not play an important role in seedling growth. We found some evidence of regeneration niche partitioning between oak species along the light gradient, a reflection of their distribution patterns as adults at the study site.ConclusionsWe conclude that inter-specific differences in seedling growth, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche segregation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;19;1;18;1;21;1100-9233;;WOS:000276656500001;

For saplings, there was no overall significant trend in the frequency, species richness, and Shannon index with respect to distance. Seedlings on the other hand showed a decrease in frequency and species richness with increasing distance from the old growth forest, implying that should recruitment limitation occur in the plantations, it will be stronger at the seed-to-seedling transition than at the seedling-to-sapling transition. Assigning species into groups based on functional traits that are associated with recruitment and regeneration was more revealing. Relative frequency of species that are moderately shade-tolerant, are shrubs, have small seeds, and are frugivore-dispersed increased in the plantations. In comparison, species that are tall trees, have large seeds and are gravity-dispersed decreased in the plantations. Multi-trait analysis showed that propagule size was the trait that could best explain the difference in the distribution of broad-leaf species in the plantations. Based on our results, we suggest to policy-makers that plantation sizes be kept to within a few hundred meters wide, and should ideally be within dispersal distance of species from natural forests that could potentially be seed sources of broad-leaf species. Otherwise, steps must be taken to drive succession such that potentially recruitment-limited species may be able to overcome barriers to regeneration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As such it is contingent on ecological circumstance. The nature of 'this ecological circumstance' is, however, hotly debated. Here, we investigate for angiosperms whether stomatal size may be this 'missing link': the primary determinant of genome size. Stomata are crucial for photosynthesis and their size affects functional efficiency.Methods Stomatal and leaf characteristics were measured for 1442 species from Argentina, Iran, Spain and the UK and, using PCA, some emergent ecological and taxonomic patterns identified. Subsequently, an assessment of the relationship between genome-size values obtained from the Plant DNA C-values database and measurements of stomatal size was carried out.Key Results Stomatal size is an ecologically important attribute. It varies with life-history (woody species, herbaceous species < vernal geophytes) and contributes to ecologically and physiologically important axes of leaf specialization. Moreover, it is positively correlated with genome size across a wide range of major taxa.Conclusions Stomatal size predicts genome size within angiosperms. Correlation is not, however, proof of causality and here our interpretation is hampered by unexpected deficiencies in the scientific literature. Firstly, there are discrepancies between our own observations and established ideas about the ecological significance of stomatal size; very large stomata, theoretically facilitating photosynthesis in deep shade, were, in this study (and in other studies), primarily associated with vernal geophytes of unshaded habitats. Secondly, the lower size limit at which stomata can function efficiently, and the ecological circumstances under which these minute stomata might occur, have not been satisfactorally resolved. Thus, our hypothesis, that the optimization of stomatal size for functional efficiency is a major ecological determinant of genome size, remains unproven.";;;;;;;;;42;6;43;1;49;0305-7364;;WOS:000276544200019;20375204

Thus, examining interspecific differences in carbon allocation patterns is useful when evaluating niche partitioning in forest communities. We hypothesized that shade-tolerant species allocate more carbon to defense and storage and less to growth compared to shade-intolerant species. In gaps and forest understory, we measured relative growth rates (RGR), carbon-based defensive compounds (condensed tannin, total phenolics), and storage compounds (total non-structural carbohydrate; TNC) in seedlings of two tree species differing in shade tolerance. RGR was greater in the shade-intolerant species, Castanea crenata, than in the shade-tolerant species, Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata, in gaps, but did not differ between the species in the forest understory. In contrast, concentrations of condensed tannin and total phenolics were greater in Quercus than in Castanea at both sites. TNC pool sizes did not differ between the species. Condensed tannin concentrations increased with increasing growth rate of structural biomass (GRstr) in Quercus but not in Castanea. TNC pool sizes increased with increasing GRstr in both species, but the rate of increase did not differ between the species. Accordingly, the amount of condensed tannin against TNC pool sizes was usually higher in Quercus than in Castanea. Hence, Quercus preferentially invested more carbon in defense than in storage. Such a large allocation of carbon to defense would be advantageous for a shade-tolerant species, allowing Quercus to persist in the forest understory where damage from herbivores and pathogens is costly. In contrast, the shade-intolerant Castanea preferentially invested more carbon in growth rather than defense (and similar amounts in storage as Quercus), ensuring establishment success in gaps, where severe competition occurs for light among neighboring plants. These contrasting carbon allocation patterns are closely associated with strategies for persistence in these species' respective habitats.";;;;;;;;;18;4;20;0;26;0029-8549;;WOS:000273795200001;19763628

Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a ""fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a ""slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition.

The experimental design permitted the comparison of the combined effects of HP clones (TD-3230, DN-3308, NM-3729J, orientation with respect to HP row (East, West) and distance from the HP row. A thinning was performed at the beginning of 2006 to increase the initial 2 m-spacing between HP within each row to a final 6 m-spacing. Percent total light transmittance (PTLT) was measured from soybean emergence to grain filling (VE-R6). Soil water content (WC) and soil N mineralisation (NMIN) were determined at two different periods corresponding to distinct soybean reproductive stages: (1) from flowering to pod formation (R1-R4) and (2) during grain filling (R5-R6). In 2005, PTLT, soil WC, soil NMIN (for R1-R4), soybean yield and yield components were significantly reduced near the HP row (2 m). The number of pods per m(2) contributed more to the variation in soybean yield than did the 100-seed size, Yield and number of pods per m(2) were highly correlated to PTLT, soil WC (R1-R4) and NMIN (R1-R4). An interaction between clone and orientation was found for field A. On the east side of the HP row, soybean yield with NM-3729 or DN-3308 was significantly higher than that with TD-3230, whereas it did not differ from that with the clone on the west side of the field. In field B, a significant interaction between orientation and distance was observed for PTLT and the number of pods per m(2). PTLT and number of pods per m(2) showed less variability on the west side compared to the east side. In 2006, a more regular PTLT distribution with respect to different orientations and distances from the HP row was observed and compared with that in 2005. Similarly, soil WC, soil NMIN, soybean yield and yield components were more uniform in 2006. These results suggest that HP clone selection, tree spacing within the rows, row spacing, orientation, and silvicultural treatments such as thinning may be useful to control the negative effects of HP competition on the intercrop.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils.We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.;;;;;;;;;203;13;200;0;219;d_c-15;;WOS:000263566600006;

Since water availability is related to gap size, these differences in microsite preference may reflect in part species-specific differences in germination at reduced water potentials.For 14 neotropical pioneer species, the hypothesis is tested that small-seeded species, with shallow initial rooting depths, reduce the risks associated with desiccation by germinating more slowly and at higher water potentials than large-seeded species.Germination occurred both more quickly and at lower water potentials with increasing seed mass. For example, Ochroma pyramidale (seed mass 5.5 mg) had a time to 50 % germination (T(50)) of 2.8 d and a median base potential for germination (psi(b50)) of -1.8 MPa while Clidemia quinquenervia (seed mass 0.017 mg) had a T(50) of 17.6 d and psi(b50) of -1.1 MPa.These data suggest that small-seeded species germinate only in comparatively moist microsites, such as small canopy gaps, which may reduce the risk of drought-induced mortality. Conversely, large-seeded species are able to germinate in the drier environment of large gaps, where they benefit by enhanced seedling growth in a high irradiance environment. The positive association of seed size and canopy gap size for optimal seedling establishment is maintained by differential germination responses to soil water availability coupled with the scaling of radicle growth rate and seed size, which collectively confer greater drought tolerance on large-seeded species.;;;;;;;;;22;0;20;1;23;0305-7364;;WOS:000260970200007;18840874

Trials were established at three degraded sites previously covered by rainforest, using two different sowing times (the beginning and end of the wet season), and a range of species having different seed sizes and successional status. The results two years after sowing showed that the effects of sowing time on tree seedling establishment were small despite pronounced differences in cumulative rainfall received by the seedlings. Results suggested that at some sites more serious weed competition might be avoided by sowing later in the season. Although some small seeded early successional species could grow quickly, the establishment of these was found to be significantly negatively affected by the growth of weeds, and in most cases, large seeded species showed more consistent establishment. On the other hand the growth rates of larger seeded species were often rather slow, limiting their contribution to early site capture. Results indicate that direct seeding can be a viable establishment method, but the identity of species to be used, the circumstances under which they should be directly sown and the most appropriate timing of sowing will vary with situations. Species characteristics, including seed size, growth rate potential and light requirement will be important to consider in relation to the probable conditions that will develop for seedlings following germination (particularly in relation to plant competition) with or without post-sowing site management, such as removal of weeds.

Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. in both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species. The effect of phylogeny in trait covariation was unimportant, in fact, a mixture of clades was represented in several groups among the species they contained, suggesting among-lineage convergence.

Evidence from five Neotropical forests;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;89;7;;;1908;1920;;10.1890/07-0207.1;;;juil-08;2008;A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests.There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival.Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.;;;;;;;;;124;4;122;0;130;d_c-58;;WOS:000258007500013;18705377

The experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of seed mass and emergence time on the performance of seedlings of Castanopsis chinensis, a large evergreen tree species with limited tolerance of shade. The treatment consisted of three light regimes: 100%, 15% and 2% of full sunlight. Germination rate and germination time showed a significant correlation with seed mass. Germination rate differed among the three light regimes. Early-emerging large-seeded seedlings in 100% light produced the heaviest seedlings, while those resulting from smaller late-emerging seeds and grown under 2% light regime produced the lightest seedlings. Relative growth rate (RGR) decreased with seed mass in all three light regimes, and seedlings of C chinensis have a higher RGR in high and intermediate light levels compared to low light. In contrast, the effect of emergence time on RGR was not significant. The growth of C chinensis seedlings were significantly influenced by seed size, emergence time, and light conditions. For each month, the mean height of seedlings was significantly greatest for large-seeded seedlings and significantly lowest for small-seeded ones, irrespective of emergence time and light conditions. Regeneration success of C chinensis appears to be regulated by the interactive effect of seed mass, emergence time and light regime. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.";;;;;;;;;26;1;24;1;27;1445-4408;;WOS:000259306500007;

In a 1-yr garden experiment in southern Chile, we address whether early size advantages or disadvantages shown by 3-month-old seedlings of three tree species differing markedly in seed size (Persea lingue > Peumus boldus > Drimys winteri) confer them with greater or lesser competitive abilities when grown in species mixtures in the following 12 months of development. Given the reported negative relationship between seed size and RGR, we predicted a negative relationship between seed size and competitive ability among these three species (i.e., D. winteri > P. boldus > P. lingue). Seedlings of D. winteri, the species producing the smallest seeds, had clear and strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of both P. boldus and P. lingue. Likewise, P. boldus, the species producing medium-sized seeds, had strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of the other two species. In addition, negative effects of D. winteri on P. boldus were generally greater than vice versa. Seedlings of P. lingue did not affect the growth of the other two species.

To investigate life-history differentiation and an objective functional classification of tree species we analysed the demography of 29 species in subtropical montane forests in north-western Argentina.2. We computed 13 growth, demographic, abundance and distribution variables based on: (i) two 5-year re-measurements of stems >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) in 8 ha of old growth forest and 4 ha of secondary forest; (ii) assessments of tree crown illumination; and (iii) sapling counts under shade and on landslides.3. We assessed the potential confounding effects of stem size and crown illumination on absolute stem diameter growth rate for the 24 most abundant species. As diameter increased, one species showed significant increases in growth rate and five showed significant reductions. Seventeen species grew significantly faster with increased exposure to light and we controlled for this confounding effect in the computation of diameter growth rates for subsequent analyses.4. A principal component analysis resulted in three meaningful and interpretable axes of demographic variation across species. The first axis (interpreted as shade tolerance) indicates that trees of species with inherently high growth rates tend to have well-exposed crowns at 10-30 cm d.b.h., have high density of trees in secondary forest and are less tolerant of shade.5. The second axis (turnover) shows that in old-growth forest short-lived species, with high mortality rates, size-class distributions with a steep negative slope and low dominance, persist due to high rates of recruitment (to >= 10 cm d.b.h.).The third axis indicates that species that colonize landslides have lower tree recruitment rates and greater growth variability in secondary forest, reflecting spatio/temporal differences in species' recruitment linked to differences in their substrate requirements for regeneration.6. Maximum height and diameter are correlated with the first and second axes, indicating that higher rates of both growth and survival permit some species to attain large size.7. All three demographic axes depict separate trade-offs that confer competitive advantage to each 'demographic type' under contrasting ecological conditions (of light availability, disturbance frequency and disturbance intensity), thus underpinning species' coexistence in dynamic forest landscapes.";;;;;;;;;15;0;15;1;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000250265700007;

We explored the reasons for this pattern by examining the relationship between seed size and CO2 response in Picea abies and P. rubens using growth analysis. The large seeded species (P. abies) responded more positively to elevated CO2 than the small seeded species (P. rubens). At the intraspecific level, P. abies individuals from large seeds responded more positively to elevated CO2 than individuals from small seeds, however, there was no significant intraspecific variation in CO2 response in P. rubens. The greater CO2 response of plants from large seeds was not simply the result of a larger starting capital compounded at the same rate as in plants from small seeds. Elevated CO2 increased relative growth rate to a greater extent in individuals from large seeds. This effect appears to be related to differences in time of establishment, source to sink ratio and nutrient availability with seed size. These results are significant not only in understanding the potential effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant populations, but also in understanding the factors affecting plant success at current atmospheric CO2 levels due to the elevation Of CO2 within the litter layer that occurs at many germination sites.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1435-8603;;WOS:000251545400010;17564949

Resprouting is a key plant attribute facilitating persistence in disturbance-prone environments. Resprouting ability in seedlings may depend on both developmental ontogeny and seed size. However, the relationships between these factors are not well explored, especially for woody species with comparatively small seeds and epigeal germination.2. We investigated resprouting capacity in seedlings from four subtropical, riparian, Myrtaceous tree species, Melaleuca leucadendra, Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa and Tristaniopsis laurina, displaying these characteristics. We recorded resprouting in response to simulated disturbance as a function of seed mass and developmental age (5-150 days post-emergence) and examined the acquisition of resprouting ability in relation to growth and biomass allocation patterns.3. Patterns of resprouting were distinct among species, but the acquisition of resprouting ability was not determined by seed mass. The 'small' seeded M. leucadendra and the 'intermediate' seeded E. camaldulensis showed unexpectedly high shoot resprouting vigour from cotyledon stage (70% resprouting at 5 days post-emergence), as well as greatest ongoing allocation to root mass and lateral root development. In contrast, in A. symphyocarpa (another species with 'intermediate' seed mass) and T. laurina (a 'large' seeded species) resprouting rates during early development were much lower (< 10%), although there was a trend towards increasing resprouting ability with age in A. symphyocarpa (> 150 days). Resprouting capacity was also independent of seedling size and relative growth rate.4. Our results indicate that the size-dependency of resprouting capacity varies considerably among these species. This suggests physiological and morphological species traits other than those directly related to reserve size or relative growth rate may convey survivorship in river environments.5. Our findings show that resprouting capacity was not related to seed size and seedling growth patterns in these four species. This is different to evidence from comparative studies undertaken in fire-prone and other temperate environments. A broader survey of seedling resprouting ability including more species is required to determine the generality of our findings in riparian species.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0022-0477;;WOS:000247320100025;

Roots play a major role in overcoming water stress and plant establishment, thus early root development in response to limited water availability becomes a strategy that may ensure seedling recruitment. We explored whether different water availabilities altered growth patterns of very young seedlings, focussing on root elongation, and hypothesized that seedling responses would depend on species-specific drought tolerance and seed size. We carried out a greenhouse experiment exposing 2-week-old seedlings of three Mediterranean shrubland species, the drought-tolerant and small-seeded Genista umbellata (L'Her.) Dum. Cours. and Lycium intricatum Boiss., and the drought-sensitive, large-seeded Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss., to two watering quantities and monitored plant and root growth weekly in glass cases for 5 weeks. We found that at such early stages, reduced water quantity enhanced root growth in all three species, regardless of drought tolerance and seed size, although root plasticity was the highest in the small-seeded and drought-tolerant Genista. In contrast, shoot elongation and mass allocation, root-to-shoot mass (R:S) ratio, was unaffected by watering. Seedlings responded to lower water availability with faster root elongation rate and greater absorptive root surface, which can account for the enhanced relative growth rate (RGR) of the small-seeded Genista and Lycium under reduced watering. By contrast, a larger root absorptive surface did not lead to higher RGR in the large-seeded Retama probably because of its greater independence from external mineral resources. Our data evidence the importance of water availability on the initial developmental stages of these three species regardless of seed size and drought tolerance. Root growth can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to deal with drying soils and decreasing soil moisture since larger roots enable to exploit unexplored soil areas of soil, which may ensure recruitment success.;;;;;;;;;32;2;31;0;33;0032-079X;;WOS:000247971600010;

Furthermore, they do not apply phylogenetic corrections, and we thus do not know how considerations of phylogenetic relationships can alter the conclusions. Finally, they usually apply only one technique to calculate habitat isolation, and we do not know how other isolation measures would change the results.We studied the issues using 30 species forming congeneric pairs occurring in fragmented dry grasslands. We measured traits related to dispersal, survival, and growth in the species and recorded distribution of the species in 215 grassland fragments.We show many strong relationships between species traits related to both dispersal and growth and species distribution in the landscape, such as the positive relationship between habitat occupancy and anemochory and negative relationships between habitat occupancy and seed dormancy. The directions of these relationships, however, often change after application of phylogenetic correction. For example, more isolated habitats host species with smaller seeds. After phylogenetic correction, however, they turn out to host species with larger seeds.The conclusions also partly change depending on how we calculate habitat isolation. Specifically, habitat isolation calculated from occupied habitats only has the highest predictive power. This indicates slow dynamics of the species.All the results support the expectation that species traits have a high potential to explain patterns of species distribution in the landscape and that they can be used to build predictive models of species distribution. The specific conclusions are, however, dependent on the technique used, and we should carefully consider this when comparing among different studies. Since different techniques answer slightly different questions, we should attempt to use analyses both with and without phylogenetic correction and explore different isolation measures whenever possible and compare the results.;;;;;;;;;44;0;42;0;44;d_c-58;;WOS:000246104600016;17536712

In temperate forests, however, little support for this hypothesis has been found under field conditions, as compared with shade-house experiments. Performance trade-offs were examined over a large resource gradient in a temperate hardwood forest.Methods The relationship between seedling Survival and seedling relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) was examined at three levels of canopy cover (forest understorey, FU; small gap, SG; and large gap, LG) and at two microsites within each level of canopy cover (presence or absence of leaf litter) for five deciduous broad-leaved tree species with different seed sizes.Key Results Within each species, both RCRm(M) and RGR(H) usually increased with increasing light levels (in the order FU < SG < LG), whereas little difference was observed based on the presence or absence of litter. Seedling survival in FU was negatively correlated with both RGR(M) and RCRH in both LG and SG. The trade-off between high-light growth and low-light survival was more evident in the relationship with LG as compared with SG. An intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR was observed along environmental gradients in Acer mono, whereas seedlings of Betula platyphylla var. japonica survived and grew better in LG.Conclusions The results presented here strongly support the idea of light gradient partitioning (i.e. species coexistence) in spatially heterogeneous light environments in temperate forests, and that further species diversity would be promoted by increased spatial heterogeneity. The intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR in Acer suggests that it has broad habitat requirements, whereas Betula has narrow habitat requirements and specializes in high-light environments.";;;;;;;;;30;0;30;0;32;0305-7364;;WOS:000245176800013;17242042

We present the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, using seven woody neotropical species.We transplanted seedlings that had recently expanded their first photosynthetic cotyledon or leaf to the forest understorey (1% of full sun) and quantified initial biomass and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) in stems, roots and storage cotyledons. We then randomly assigned seedlings to control and two stress treatments: light reduction (0.08% of full sun for 8 weeks) and complete defoliation.First-year survival of control seedlings, a comparative measure of shade tolerance, differed widely among species. The two stress treatments reduced survival and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species. Shade-tolerant species were little impacted by the stress treatments, whereas the two least shade-tolerant species experienced 100% mortality.In all treatments, 8-week and first-year survival was positively correlated with initial TNC pool size in stems and roots. By contrast, survival was generally not correlated with initial TNC concentration in any organ, TNC pools in cotyledons, seed mass or seedling biomass.TNC in stems and roots, but not in cotyledons, decreased in response to light reduction and defoliation over 8 weeks. Leaf area recovery of defoliated seedlings was positively correlated with initial TNC pools in stems and roots.First-year survival in each treatment was negatively correlated with 0-8 week RGR of control seedlings, suggesting higher stress tolerance of species with inherently slow growth rates in shade. RGR of control seedlings from 0 to 8 weeks was negatively correlated with initial TNC pools, but not concentrations, in stems and roots. After 8 weeks, RGR was positive for all species, without clear relationships with survival or TNC.We conclude that carbohydrate storage in stems and roots enhances long-term survival in shade by enabling seedlings to cope with periods of biotic and abiotic stress. Carbohydrate storage is a key functional trait that can explain species differences in growth and survival that lead to species coexistence through niche assembly processes and life-history trade-offs.;;;;;;;;;91;12;96;3;108;0022-0477;;WOS:000244114400018;

First the means by which seed images are acquired and processed shall be reviewed, to account how imaging technology analysis has been developed in the last two decades. Automated recording of seed size, shape, and colour data to assess germination and vigour can improve those obtained by traditional tests. The aspect of automated image analysis potential to identify and characterise cultivars and weed seeds on the basis of differences in seed morphology is in line with the development of new non-invasive methods in seed sorting. This topic includes also X-ray imaging technique application, which allows correlations between different seed morphological categories and viability in economically important tree and crop species. Some reference are also made to the recent application of computer tomography to the study of internal morphology and function in seeds. The future perspectives focus on the interest of seed researcher and analysts in introducing a computer vision system in a seed laboratory to integrate data obtained by human visual inspection in seed processing and management. The ultimate goal should be to create extensive databases where matching of different bio-morphological traits of a large number of seed species may be performed for purity analysis, taxonomy screening and viability and vigour prediction. Combining digital imaging with genomics and proteomics, traits of economically important crop plants might be characterized more accurately, and, so, a new 'holistic vision' of the form and function could be provided to the study of seed biology.;;;;;;;;;12;0;9;1;12;0251-0952;;WOS:000251624700001;

This study investigated how we could benefit by careful seed selection prior to any regeneration attempts. The effects of seed size and parent tree were evaluated on seed variables and seedling growth. One subset of seeds was used to evaluate seed variables (e.g. moisture content), and another subset was used to characterize seedling growth (e.g. root width). Both seed size and parent tree had an effect on the majority of seed variables and seedling growth, with larger seeds performing better. Our results confirm that careful selection of seed size (specifically larger sizes) and parent tree of these high-valued species gives rise to more vigorous seedlings that could increase regeneration success. Nursery practices could also benefit by reducing production cost when regenerating a site by seeds as opposed to transplanting seedlings.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0251-0952;;WOS:000251624700026;

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-301% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0266-4674;;WOS:000242132900005;

Using mandibles as tools, they have to perforate the seed shell to reach the nutritious interior. The isometric growth of larval mandibles, known from predatory species, would result in a changing ratio between seed and mandible size during the course of development. The stable size of host tree seeds should select an optimum mandible size, similar for the three larval instars in spermophageous species. We found an increasing tendency to maintain the length of the apical mandible part (apex) in seed feeding species. The size increase is higher in the species from Australia, Africa and South East Asia than in the New World species of the genus Notiobia. Feeding experiments have revealed that larvae of species with a stronger increase in apex growth are also able to develop as predators of Drosophila larvae. Our results furthermore point to an influence of beetle size and shell hardness of the host tree seeds on the apex size and its growth rate.;;;;;12th European Carabidologists Meeting (ECM XII);SEP 19-22, 2005;;Murcia, SPAIN;3;0;4;0;4;0785-8760;;WOS:000241842800017;

This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (M-A), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny.Light vs. M-A relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower M-A than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to M-A increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR.The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species' successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.;;;;;;;;;70;6;67;1;77;0022-0477;;WOS:000235332300019;

However, recent studies suggest that both the occurrence of AMF on rain forest plants and the dependence of rain forest plants on AMF can be highly variable. We examined the occurrence and levels of AMF colonization of some common seedling species in a tropical and a subtropical rain forest site in Queensland, Australia. We also used a long-term database to compare the growth and mortality rates of seedling species that rarely formed AMF with those that regularly formed AMF. In both forests, more than one-third of the seedling species rarely formed AMF associations, while 40% of species consistently formed AMF in the tropical site compared to 27% in the subtropical site. Consistent patterns of AMF occurrence were observed among plant families at the two sites. Variation among seedling species in AMF occurrence or colonization was not associated with differences in seed mass among species, variation in seedling size and putative age within a species, or lack of AMF inoculum in the soil. Comparisons of four seedling species growing both in the shaded understory and in small canopy gaps revealed an increase in AMF colonization in two of the four species in gaps, suggesting that light limitation partially explains the low occurrence of AMF. Seedling survival was significantly positively associated with seed biomass but not with AMF colonization. Furthermore, seedling species that regularly formed AMF and those that did not had similar rates of growth and survival, suggesting that mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal strategies were equivalent in these forests. Furthermore, the high numbers of seedlings that lacked AMF and the overall low rate of seedling growth (the average seedling required 6 years to double its height) suggest that most seedlings did not receive significant indirect benefits from AMF through connection to canopy trees via a common mycorrhizal network.;;;;;;;;;12;1;14;0;14;0940-6360;;WOS:000235717000003;16133252

Are there competitive response strategies for light in juvenile plants? 2. If so, do plant traits (e.g. seed weight, relative growth rate, height and biomass) correlate with the strategies?Location: Controlled greenhouse study using perennial vegetation typical of wet meadows in Northeast Ohio, USA.Methods: We used two light manipulations in a greenhouse to screen ten replicates of 19 plant species for three proposed competitive response strategies ('escape', 'forage', 'persist'). We measured the time it took a seedling to die and the maximum height achieved when grown in the dark to assess two strategies, persist and escape. The biomass of seedlings when grown under a controlled, low-intensity, shifting light source was measured to test a third strategy, forage.Results: We found significant variation across species in the measurements used to assess each strategy. The species ranking for each strategy was not concordant across strategies. Traits were found that correlated with the escape strategy (seed weight, height and biomass) and persist strategy (time to reach maximum height). No traits were found that correlate with the forage strategy.Conclusions: There appear to be trade-offs by plants in the three strategies tested in this study. Species which had the best performance on one strategy typically scored poorly on the other strategies. However, many species fall in the middle range, ranking similarly across the 'persist', 'escape', and 'forage' strategies.;;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;1100-9233;;WOS:000235669200003;

Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species.4 Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly.5 We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment.6 Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.;;;;;;;;;53;8;54;0;64;0022-0477;;WOS:000233287500012;

Seedlings were grown in eight microhabitat types composed of paired gap and shaded understory sites in each of four soil types. We defined performance trade-offs relevant to coexistence as significant pairwise rank reversals for species performance between contrasting situations, of which we characterize three types: microhabitat, fitness component, and ontogenetic. Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps). Third, the most frequent rank reversals between species pairs occurred between early and later ontogenetic stages, especially between fitness components in contrasting microhabitats. Overall, 15 of 36 pairs of potentially competing species exhibited some type of seedling performance trade-off, two species pairs never outperformed one another, and for 19 species pairs one species was a consistent better performer.

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;21;1435-8603;;WOS:000232416400006;16163613

Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1 - 1.5m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis ( PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size.Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size.Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.;;;;;;;;;12;0;12;0;12;0305-7364;;WOS:000230724400015;15944175

Experimental field data and interspecific comparative analyses were used to detect effects of seed mass on seedling performance within and among seven species of Psychotria sown in gaps and shaded rainforest sites. In addition we compared the effects of seed mass within and among species to detect concordance between the two ecological scales. We used two comparative methods: phylogenetically independent contrasts and cross-species correlations.2. Among species, we detected weak evidence of a positive correlation between seed mass and the probability of emergence in the shaded forest, and no effects of seed mass in gaps.3. Among species, no significant correlations between seed mass and either seedling survival or seedling recruitment were found in any habitat. Other variables specific to each subgenus appear to be more important than seed mass in determining survival in the shaded forest.4. There was a negative correlation between seed mass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both habitats. In gaps, small-seeded taxa exhibited particularly high RGR, compensating for the initial advantages of higher seed mass.5. All species studied exhibited recruitment in gaps equal to or higher than that in the shaded forest. However, recruitment success in shaded forest relative to gaps increased with seed mass, indicating a higher affinity for shaded forest among larger-seeded taxa, but this relationship was only detected using PICS analysis.6. Correlations between seed mass and seedling mass are similar within and among species, indicating a simple principle of mass transference. In contrast, correlations between seed mass and seedling emergence, seedling survival, seedling recruitment and RGR depend on the scale at which they are observed.;;;;;;;;;11;5;12;0;17;0269-8463;;WOS:000231397300020;
Seedmass;J;Kang, H;;;;;;;;A five-year study of mast seeding in Pinus densiflora;;;;;;;;JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY;;;;48;2;;;159;169;;;;;JUN 30 2005;2005;I examined the annual pattern of seed production in three Korean populations of Pinus densiflora from 1998 to 2002. During the fall season, data were collected on the numbers of cones per tagged tree, as well as seed counts, their mass, and seed set following dehiscence. Dbh was measured for individual trees during each spring. Overall, 80.3% of the trees produced seed cones in even-numbered years compared with 51.6% in odd-numbered years. Moreover, trees that matured seed cones in even years produced 12 times more seeds per tree than those in odd years. Tree diameters generally increased significantly during the summers after odd-numbered years, although the trees at one site showed a consistent growth rate each year after 2000. Annual variations in individual seed mass, seed set, and the proportion of damaged seed cones occurred largely within odd or even years. Based on these results the following conclusions were made: 1) seed-cone production of P densiflora is somewhat synchronized, but is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, 2) P densiflora tends to undergo mast seeding at two-year intervals, and 3) this alternate-year excess in seed crop may have evolved to increase fitness, though the exact evolutionary mechanism is unclear.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;1226-9239;;WOS:000230506100002;

Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance.2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass.3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient.4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient.5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies.;;;;;;;;;85;1;79;1;86;0022-0477;;WOS:000229283000006;

RGR was greatest in the tree-fall gap in both species. Allocation to leaves was proportionally higher in the forest interior. SLA tended to be lower in the tree-fall gap, intermediate in the forest edge, and greater in the forest interior in both species. In addition, SLA of D. winteri seedlings was always greater than that of G. avellana in all three habitats. Survival of both species was greatest Survival of seedlings of the larger-seeded species, G. avellana, was greatest during the first few months of the experiment in the forest interior, but then dropped significantly in the period during which seedlings of the smaller-seeded species, D. winteri, survived in greater numbers.

The seeds differed one order of magnitude in their total volume. However, independently of their size and the location of the maternal tree, the relationship between the volume occupied by dispersal and establishment structures was relatively constant (similar to 1) and showed a normal distribution with low skewness, indicating stabilizing selection. These results Suggest that, in the habitats studied, dispersal and establishment processes may have similar importance to C. angustifolia. In species with seeds confined in pods, and therefore strongly space-limited, the relative volume of their seeds occupied by dispersal and establishment structures could be a better measure of the trade-off between these two processes than the variation in seed size.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;1;1;0034-7744;;WOS:000232593200007;17354420

A combination of field and controlled experiments was used on seeds and seedlings of these congeners to determine species characteristics that may be contributing to these floristic changes. Acer platanoides experienced lower rates of seed predation than A. saccharum in field experiments. Differences in the dispersal and allocation characteristics of the two species were small and not likely to explain the relative success of A. platanoides. Greenhouse-grown seedlings of A. platanoides were much larger than those of A. saccharum because of differences in seed size, not differences in growth rate. These data suggest that preferential seed predation and initial seed size differences may explain greater relative success in Acer platanoides seedlings.;;;;;;;;;10;0;10;0;11;1092-6194;;WOS:000228492500003;

This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.;;;;;;;;;42;6;41;3;49;0029-8549;;WOS:000226357400005;15503163

Wide variation in initial spatial patterns of natural regeneration of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) between managed and undisturbed white pine forests of the Great Lakes region of North America has been attributed to differences in understory light levels and the frequency of substrates suitable for germination and seedling establishment. To explore the potential influence of seed mass on these observed patterns, the interaction of seed mass and light on early growth of white pine was investigated in a greenhouse study. Seedlings of five half-sib families differing in mean seed mass were grown for 8 and 14 weeks under moderate and low light conditions representing managed and undisturbed pine stands, respectively. Family differences in seedling biomass and root system development under each light environment were associated with positive, linear relationships with mean seed mass. Family and seed mass had a comparatively weak influence on biomass partitioning and relative growth rate. Moderate light improved seedling growth regardless of seed mass, but relative expression of seed mass effects on seedling traits was unaffected by light environment. These results suggest differential recruitment of white pine in managed and undisturbed stands is unrelated to variation in seed mass.;;;;;;;;;8;1;6;1;9;ao_t-26;;WOS:000226031700011;

Comparisons among closely related species should reveal adaptive differentiation in species characteristics that are consistent with their differences in geographic distribution. This expectation was tested by comparing characteristics of seedlings of spruce species in relation to environmental factors representative of their current natural ranges.Methods Seedlings were grown from a total of 34 Populations representing eight North American spruce (Picea) species in a controlled environment chamber for 140 d. Traits related to the potential of seedling establishment, including tolerance to stress events (high temperature, desiccation) were evaluated. Correlations were sought between these characteristics and modal values of latitude, aridity and continentality in the geographic range of each species.Key Results Many seedling traits changed significantly in response to stress events, but Only the response of chlorophyll concentration differed significantly among species. Components of seedling growth were good correlates of species distribution. Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with latitude, and leaf weight ratio (LWR) negatively correlated with aridity. Seed mass was negatively correlated with latitude.Conclusions Relationships found between seedling traits and geographical variation in environmental conditions suggest that factors such as temperature regime, water availability and perhaps litter depth affect species range in North American spruces. Seedling characteristics appear to be elements in a reasonably distinct environmental niche for each spruce species at the continental scale.

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

However, inherent trade-offs between shade tolerance and drought tolerance, as hypothesized in the literature, would constrain potential niche differentiation. For thirteen species of European trees and shrubs the impacts were determined of moderate and extreme drought on the growth and survival of first-year seedlings in a given soil volume, in irradiances in the range typical for temperate forest and scrub understories (3% daylight) and large gaps (30% daylight). Pots were watered differentially each second day to equalize soil water content across species and irradiances. Comparisons within and across species supported independent tolerances of shade and drought rather than trade-offs. For all species, drought reduced relative growth rate in dry mass by the same proportion in 3% daylight and in 30% daylight. Consequently, drought generally reduced final dry mass significantly more strongly in 30% daylight than in 3% daylight. Extreme drought led to earlier mortality in 30% daylight than in 3% daylight for nine of the eleven species tested, to earlier mortality in 3% daylight for one species, and to equal mortality rate in both irradiances for one species. For each species, growth-based shade tolerance was quantified as the ratio of absolute growth in low irradiance to that in high irradiance, and growth-based drought tolerance as the ratio of absolute growth in low water supply to that in high water supply. Across species, growth-based shade tolerance varied approximate to9-fold, and growth-based drought tolerance approximate to2-fold; species' tolerances correlated respectively with indices of field establishment in shade and drought. Growth-based drought tolerance correlated with survival time in extreme drought. Experimentally quantified shade and drought tolerances varied independently for the 13 species tested, indicating the potential for extensive species niche differentiation in combinations of irradiance and water supply.";;;;;;;;;78;1;72;2;80;0030-1299;;WOS:000223821600010;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Germination tests were conducted under five osmotic potential levels. Seedlings from large (LS) and small (SS) seeds were grown at four soil moisture levels. Observations were made on height, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits such as relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Seeds of pioneer species and large seeds, within species, germinated earlier, and with increasing water stress, per cent germination and germination velocity declined. RGR was inversely related with drought tolerance. R:S ratio increased, RGR and SLA declined, but NAR increased with water stress. Notwithstanding successional status, the slow-growing species registered minimum reduction in biomass due to water stress. The response of LS and SS seedlings also differed for some of the growth variables. Increase in NAR could be a compensatory response to water stress, and the marked allocational plasticity could help maximize capture of the limited resource. Seedlings from smaller seeds, particularly of fast-growing species, would be able to cope with mild drought by morphogenetic and physiological plastic response in a better way than those from large seeds.

Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment.2. We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species).3. Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1).4. Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1) if mortality continued at the same rate for some time.5. The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle. One possibility is that the greater seed production of small-seeded species (m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1)) is partly offset by larger canopies and longer reproductive life spans in large-seeded species.;;;;;;;;;262;15;265;2;286;0022-0477;;WOS:000221424600001;

The seedlings of larger seeded species generally perform better than those of smaller seeded species under a variety of hazards. The reserve effect proposes that larger seeded species retain a greater proportion of their initial seed resources and their seedlings are therefore better provisioned to cope with post-deployment resource deficits.2. This hypothesis was tested with a suite of 32 Australian rain forest species with storage cotyledons, and seed reserve mass ranging from 36 mg to 25 g. Seedlings germinated in dim light were harvested as their first set of leaves became fully expanded, dissected into shoot, root and left-over cotyledons, dried and weighed.3. In cross-species, allometric analyses, the mean mass of the shoot-plus-root scaled less than proportionately (slope c. 0.8), and mean cotyledon mass more than proportionately (slope c. 1.1) with either initial seed mass or seedling mass. These slopes were significantly different from each other. Both conditions for a reserve effect were therefore fulfilled. Cotyledons ranged from 45% of total seedling mass in the smallest species, to 92% in the largest.4. Solid evidence for a reserve effect was detected within two of four families tested (Lauraceae and Myrtaceae), but only in 7 of the 22 species for which there were sufficient data.5. Even if the reserve effect has present day utility for enhanced seedling performance in larger seeded species, it may have evolved in response to selection for a greater relative retention of initial seed mass during seedling deployment in larger seeded species, combined with selection for greater deployment of seed reserves to the initial shoot and root of smaller seeded species.;;;;;;;;;25;3;24;1;29;0022-0477;;WOS:000221424600003;

Seedlings from large (LS) and small seeds ( SS) were grown at two CO2 levels ( ambient and elevated, 700 - 750 ppm). CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and foliar N were determined after 30 d exposure to elevated CO2. Seedlings were harvested after 30 d and 60 d exposure periods. Height, diameter, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits (RGR, NAR, SLA, R: S) were determined. Seedling biomass across species was positively related with seed mass. Within species, LS seedlings exhibited greater biomass than SS seedlings. Elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass for all the species. The relative growth rate ( RGR), net assimilation rate ( NAR), CO2 assimilation rate, R: S ratio and water use efficiency increased under elevated CO2. However, the positive impact of elevated CO2 was down regulated beyond 30 d exposure. Specific leaf area ( SLA), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance declined due to exposure to elevated CO2. Fast growing, early successional species exhibited greater RGR, NAR and CO2 assimilation rate. Per cent enhancement in such traits was greater for slow growing species. The responses of individual species did not follow functional types (viz. legumes, non-legumes). The enhancement in biomass and RGR was greater for large-seeded species and LS seedlings within species.

The study comprised five dry tropical tree species: Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth, Acacia nilotica (L.) Delile, Phyllanthus emblica L., Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Beddome, and Terminalia chebula Retz. Of these, Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, and P. emblica are pioneer species. The former two are N-fixing legumes. Terminalia arjuna and T. chebula are nonpioneer, nonleguminous species. Albizia procera, P. emblica, and T. arjuna are fast growing, while the remaining two are slow-growing species. Seedlings of these species from large and small seeds were grown at four N input levels (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg N.ha(-1)). Height and leaf area were measured periodically. At the end of the experiment (after 4 months) biomass and other growth traits, namely relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and root/shoot ratio, were determined. Foliar N and net CO2 assimilation rates were also determined. The species responded differentially (66%-282% increase in biomass) to elevated N supply, but the response was not associated with between-species seed size variation. However, within species, small-seed seedlings exhibited a greater response. The elevated N input resulted in a greater enhancement in relative growth rate of the slow-growing species. The species response did not follow functional types such as pioneer versus nonpioneer, legumes versus nonlegumes, and deciduous versus evergreen, but rather was individualistic.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;ao_t-26;;WOS:000220266400002;

We tested the hypothesis that the type of microhabitat suitable for O. europaea recruitment is influenced by microhabitat-specific relationships between seed size and seedling growth rate. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments evaluating seedling growth and survival as a function of seed size, microhabitat (determined by presence/absence of scrub cover), and competition (established by means of seedling density gradients). Our results show that, first, seed size was related to seedling size and to differential growth rate. Second, seedling growth rate was negatively correlated with initial seedling size, although this correlation varied among microhabitats and temporally. Third, seedling survival differed between microhabitats and was positively affected by initial seedling size until the end of the summer drought. Finally, the effect of seedling size on survival was partly mediated by its negative relationship with growth rate. However, the combined effect of size and growth on seedling survival varied between microhabitats. We conclude that establishment depended on microbabitats through facilitation and inhibition processes, and that seed size-related growth rate strongly affected seedling fate. It is noteworthy that the effectiveness of the size-correlated growth depended on microhabitat.;;;;;;;;;28;3;26;1;31;1195-6860;;WOS:000224339300008;

These species were assigned to four groups representing their regeneration patterns (association with either gaps or low light microsites as seedlings and/or as larger trees). The distribution of tree diameters was calculated from early- (n = 28) and late-successional (n = 36) plots to determine where the species were regenerating, Six years later 1110 of these trees were remeasured Average net growth increment was used as an estimate of growth rate, and maximum growth increment as potential growth rate, for each species. Most shade-tolerant, late successional species had low growth rates and a lognormal size distribution in late-successional plots, as expected. One species in this group, however, had the highest estimated average growth rate in the study. The second group of species, found in shade as seedlings but abundant as small trees in early-successional plots (e.g., ""mid-successional""), as well as the third group, found in gaps as seedlings but most abundant in late-successional plots, shared high growth rates. The fourth group, pioneer species establishing in large gaps, were not regenerating in late-successional plots but, unexpectedly, had estimated growth rates comparable to the other groups. Tongan rain forest has diverse regeneration functional types, analogous to those found in richer continental tropical forest, but perhaps represented by different numbers of tree species.";;;;;;;;;16;0;14;1;16;0028-825X;;WOS:000187572400006;

However, there were clear differences in allocation patterns and in phenotypic responses to light intensity. Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA).4 Savanna species also exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and net assimilation rate in response to light intensity. An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs. Many of these traits were correlated to seed mass, which is itself highly conserved within genera.;;;;;;;;;82;0;87;18;94;0022-0477;;WOS:000183144700014;

Fertilization effects on biomass accumulation, relative growth rate and tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were examined for seedlings grown under relatively high light. Higher light conditions in gaps are expected as human disturbance expands in tropical landscapes. Two questions were asked: (1) Does nutrient addition enhance growth or result in nutrient accumulation in the tissues of tropical tree seedlings grown in pots under high light? (2) Are these responses conditional on their adaptations to light availability, seed mass or growth form? Most of the species (73% of light-demanding and 60% of shade-tolerant) demonstrated a positive growth response to fertilization. The magnitude of the response of light-demanding species was more than twice that of shade-tolerant species. A higher proportion of shade-tolerant species accumulated nutrients in their tissues (up to 95% for P), but over half the light-demanding species did so as well. For both types of species, a higher percentage accumulated P than N. Responses in growth and in P accumulation were negatively correlated with seed mass. Shrubs responded more than trees in biomass accumulation, but there was a trend toward greater response by trees in relative growth rate and N and P accumulation. The results suggest that variation in nutrient availability could affect the structure of tropical forests regenerating from large-scale disturbance. In fertile sites, competitive exclusion may occur within the light-demanding species, resulting in a decline in local tree diversity. Depending on the effects of human disturbance on nutrient availability, loss of tree diversity at a local scale may compound diversity loss due to habitat destruction at the landscape scale.;;;;;;;;;33;0;33;2;36;0266-4674;;WOS:000183658600003;

Using a combination of field sampling and shadehouse experiments, we investigated the influence of propagule size and predispersal insect damage on the establishment and early growth of the three common mangrove species on the Caribbean coast of Panama: Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle. In our field samples, all three species exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in mature propagule size, and suffered moderate to high levels of predispersal attack by larval insects. Rates of insect attack were largely independent of propagule size both within and among trees. Our experimental studies using undamaged mature propagules showed that, for all three species, seedlings established at high rates regardless of propagule size. However, propagule size did have a marked effect on early seedling growth: seedlings that developed from larger propagules grew more rapidly. Predispersal insect infestations that had destroyed or removed a substantial amount of tissue, particularly if that tissue was meristematic or conductive, reduced the establishment of propagules of all three species. The effect of sublethal tissue damage or loss on the subsequent growth of established seedlings varied among the three mangrove species. For Avicennia, the growth response was graded: for a propagule of a given size, the more tissue lost, the slower the growth of the seedling. For Laguncularia, the response to insect attack appeared to be all-or-none. If the boring insect penetrated the outer spongy seed coat and reached the developing embryo, it usually caused sufficient damage to prevent a seedling from developing. On the other hand, if the insect damaged but did not penetrate the seed coat, a completely healthy seedling developed and its growth rate was indistinguishable from a seedling developing from an undamaged propagule of the same size. Similar to Avicennia, if an infestation did not completely girdle a Rhizophora seedling, it survived, but grew at a reduced rate. In summary, our experiments demonstrated that natural levels of variation in propagule size and predispersal damage by insects translate into significant differences in seedling performance in terms of establishment and/or early growth.-Such differences are sufficiently large that they could influence the intensity and outcome of competitive interactions during forest regeneration.;;;;;;;;;24;2;24;0;27;0029-8549;;WOS:000183722700010;12684857

We assessed the role of relative growth rate (RGR), life form, seed and fruit mass as potential constraints of plant phenology. In a comparison of traits of 22 Mediterranean woody plant species, the duration of the primary shoot growing period decreased from climbers to shrubs and to trees. A hypothesised negative association between RGR and primary shoot growth duration did not emerge in our species set. The mechanism underlying phenological differences between plant life forms might relate to differences in the proportion of respiring to photosynthetic tissues, which decreases from climbers to trees. It is suggested that the degree of shoot preformation within the bud correlates with primary shoot growth duration, but not with RGR. Development of big fruits and seeds competes for carbon with vegetative growth. Indeed, species with bigger seeds and fruits exhibited shorter primary shoot growing periods, which tended to overlap with flower bud formation and flowering periods. We suggest that duration of primary shoot growth allow to short out the species between two extreme growth strategies: The conservative one would be characterised by a concentration of the primary shoot growth into a short period, free of frosts and droughts, and by a diversion of part of the current resources to assure next year's growth. The opportunistic strategy, on the other extreme, would be defined by the allocation of resources to current growth whenever they are available, achieving longer growing periods at the expense of higher risk of tissue damage. These strategies should have been selected for in environments of predictable and unpredictable resource availability, respectively.;;;;;;;;;26;0;26;1;28;1385-0237;;WOS:000182132400010;

Shadehouse effects were investigated by examining the seedling growth and morphological properties of four shade-tolerant tree species from north-east Queensland in the forest and in neutral-density shadehouses for up to 1 y. Understorey plots were compared with 0.8% shadehouses, and single-treefall gaps were compared with 10% shadehouses. Seedlings of all species showed higher growth rates in the shadehouses compared with the equivalent forest treatments. Nonetheless, trends found between high- and low-light growth rates in the shadehouse seedlings were mirrored in forest-grown seedlings. Specific leaf area (SLA) values in the shadehouses provided a good approximation of SLA in the forest for species in both light treatments. In contrast, biomass allocation and leaf area ratios were only comparable for forest and shadehouse seedlings grown in the high-light treatment. Furthermore. seedlings grown in shadehouses differed significantly from forest-grown seedlings in terms of their root morphology. Despite the differences in absolute values of plant characters in the shadehouse and forest seedlings, 65% of significant differences detected between high- and low-light plant characters in shadehouse-grown seedlings were also found in the forest-grown plants.;;;;;;;;;13;8;14;1;25;0266-4674;;WOS:000182606600005;

We explored these hypotheses using experimental studies in both field and controlled conditions. Our experiments examined intraspecific effects of seed mass on seedling demography in eight sympatric woody species of Psychotria. We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.;;;;;;;;;47;5;50;3;56;d_c-58;;WOS:000181482600017;

We examined patterns of growth and mortality among shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and survival rates across species.2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight.3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2% daylight showed no significant relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR(M) ) in 0.8% and 10% light.4 The RGR(M) values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR(M) was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR(M) was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass).5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have important implications for the coexistence of shade-tolerant tropical tree species.;;;;;;;;;52;4;55;1;61;0022-0477;;WOS:000180744300008;

Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N-2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competition - the CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.;;;;;;;;;241;5;217;2;262;0028-646X;;WOS:000180609700002;

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg.

To determine the effects of above- and belowground constraints on tree seedling germination, survival, and growth, we used four mowing and shading treatments of the Saccharum. Shading the Saccharum effectively eliminated it, whereas mowing led to increased light aboveground, but did not reduce Saccharum growth rate. Germination, survival, and growth of tree seedlings approximately doubled in shade treatments compared to the unshaded control, but were lowest when the Saccharum was mowed three times. Fire significantly decreased germination and survival.Some species did not follow these general trends, however: we identified four species groups that varied in their response to Saccharum competition. Very small-seeded, light-demanding species performed poorly, and we do not recommend their use in reforestation because they tolerate neither above- nor belowground constraints imposed by the Saccharum. Light-demanding species with large seeds were limited by aboveground constraints, namely, shading.

A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey).2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mm N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth.3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun.4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia , the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen.5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea , the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade.6. Functional morphology of cotyledons and concentration of seed nitrogen deserve as much attention as seed size as correlates of contrasting seedling regeneration strategies.;;;;;;;;;51;1;47;2;54;0269-8463;;WOS:000177256800002;

We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama.2 To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design.3 Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots.4 We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season.5 In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.6 We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence-establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.;;;;;;;;;160;17;168;10;193;0022-0477;;WOS:000175666900013;

Previous studies on the combined effects of light and nutrient supply on the growth rates of plants have involved adding nutrients to soils to levels rarely (or never) met by the plants in nature. As a better test of the likely response of plants to root competition for nutrients. we grew for 1 year seedlings of six species of Australian rainforest tree on forest topsoil undiluted and on soil diluted 50/50, 25/75 and 5/95 with coarse sand. Seedlings were grown in tall tubes in 6 and 9% daylight, equivalent to gap-edge and gap-centre conditions.2. The six species varied in their light requirements for establishment and onward growth.3. One species grew significantly and markedly more quickly on soil diluted 50/50 with sand (Elaeocarpus grandis). Improved aeration is the most likely explanation.4. The extent of inhibition by soil dilution correlated positively with the absolute amount of new dry mass accreted in one year, whether the larger accretion resulted from a combination of high relative growth rate (RGR) and small embryo size, or moderate RGR and larger embryo size.5. Soil dilution generally reduced leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio, but had no significant effect on specific leaf area.6. In all species the overall concentration of nitrogen in the whole plant declined with soil dilution, in the four species tested, N concentration in leaves declined, and it is likely that the reduction in growth arose partly from a reduced unit leaf rate. Most species showed increases in the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg with soil dilution, or no change, but in Diploglottis bracteata the concentrations of Ca and Mg, especially in the older leaves, declined markedly with soil dilution, and one of these cations could have been limiting growth.7. Extrapolation of the results to the field suggests that in single-treefall gaps the fastest growing species will the most inhibited by root competition.8. The soil-dilution technique is likely to be more appropriate than nutrient addition as an indicator of sensitivity to root competition on a given soil.;;;;;;;;;8;0;8;0;9;0269-8463;;WOS:000175467600009;

Therefore, we examined the effects of both family identity and simulated acid rain on Pinus densiflora seedlings over a 34-week period, beginning at germination. We were able to evaluate the importance of family and pH treatment independent of seed mass and germination date by considering the latter two variables as covariates. Seeds were collected from six randomly chosen trees that were assumed to represent different genotypes. After germination in a controlled environment, the seedlings were moved outdoors. Each was then subjected twice a week to 40 mL of simulated acid rain, at a pH of either 3.0 or 5.6. We examined variations in germination date, seedling height, needle numbers and lengths, and root and shoot masses. The maternal family effect was significant for all characters over the entire test period. Strong effects of pH treatment were detected only at the later growth stages. Artificial rain with a pH of 3.0 enhanced growth rates, particularly aboveground, compared with seedlings treated with pH 5.6 rain. However, regardless of pH, certain groups of maternal siblings consistently performed better in almost all parameters. The exception was for mean germination date, which differed among families only at a pH of 3.0. Therefore, although we demonstrated that acid rain affected both the date of germination as well as seedling growth rates in P. densiflora, the responses differed among maternal families, and were also associated with seed mass and germination date.;;;;;;;;;2;2;2;0;4;1226-9239;;BCI:BCI200200238041;

Seedling emergence rate was higher than 90% independently of the duration of seed storage or parental trees. Seed storage shortened significantly the time and increased the uniformity of seedling emergence. Consequently, the delayed seedling emergence from fresh seeds could be explained by epicotyl dormancy. Seed size varied with parental tree. Seedling growth rate was greatly affected by seed size, independently of storage treatment. Seedlings originating from large seeds (>5 g) had the fastest growth rates and seedlings from the smallest seeds (<4 g) had the slowest. Final shoot height, however, depended on the duration of seed storage. The seed size and the duration of storage had a great effect on the initial rate of leaf production, but did not affect the final number of leaves. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was reduced as the duration of seed storage increased but was independent of parental tree (i.e., seed size). Seedling biomass was positively related to seed size. The duration of seed storage reduced the shoot/root ratio, but no significant effect was observed among parental trees. The shoot/root value of seedlings from stored seed was about 1.5 and the one of seedlings from fresh seed was about 2.;;;;;;;;;9;0;7;0;9;1286-4560;;WOS:000170394500005;

Populations exhibited different shoot elongation patterns with montane southern (40-44 degreesN) and lowland northern (58-60 degreesN) populations having lower growth rates and earlier onset of growth cessation than those from the central lowland part (47-55 degreesN) of European species' range. Average absolute growth rates ranged from 6.6 mm per day for populations of southern origin to 9.2 mm per day for populations from central Europe. Shoot elongation period explained ca. 50-60% and differences in growth rate from 40 to 50% of total differences in annual increment among population groups. There was a linear relationship (r(2)=0.73, P <0.0001) between mean annual temperature (m.a.t.) of seed origin and mean relative growth rate. Populations originating from seeds collected in colder regions (3-6 degrees m.a.t.) had shorter shoot elongation periods than those from warmer (7-10 degreesC m.a.t.) environments. The duration of the shoot elongation period alone explained 86% of total height variation at age 10 years in this experimental site and from 42 to 80% variation in five other sites (in Poland and Croatia) established with same seed lots.

We crossed nine maternal plants with pollen from six pollen donors in a clonal B. pendula seed orchard, measured the pollen-tube growth rates for every cross, and analyzed the performance of the resulting seeds and seedlings. The only significant positive correlation was found between pollen-tube growth rate and seed mass when we controlled for seed number per inflorescence. Using seed mass as a covariate. we found that only maternal parent had a significant effect on the number of seeds per inflorescence, the percentage of germinable and embryonic seeds, and early seedling growth. Both maternal and paternal parents had significant effects on seedling height after 85 d of growth. These results are in concordance with the general view that maternal effects are usually most apparent in seed characters and during early plant growth.

Knowledge of seed germination and seedling establishment is required for the success of efforts on restoration of these forests. This review focuses on the ecological requirements at seed and seedling stages, and collates the current knowledge of seed viability, dormancy, germination pattern and seedling behaviour of dry tropical tree species. The spatio-temporal variations within the tropical dry forest biome in soil moisture, light, temperature, nutrients and intensity of predation, significantly affect the seed and seedling traits of component species. The majority of dry tropical species possess orthodox seeds which are characterized by dormancy, while a few have recalcitrant seeds which possess little or no dormancy. Seed coat dormancy, which can be overcome by mechanical or acid scarification or sometimes by transit through animal guts, is most prevalent in the dry tropical forest species. Persistent species dominating the undisturbed portions of the forest have bigger seeds compared to those that mostly occur in disturbed regions and require shade for the survival of their seedlings. Shade demand is associated with drought endurance, and may be absolute in species such as Guettarda parviflora and Coccoloba microstachya, or facultative as in Plumeria alba and Bursera simaruba. The fluctuation in temperature significantly affects seed germination in several species of dry Afromontane forest trees of Ethiopia. Seedling mortality is primarily a function of moisture stress during the dry period. Adaptive responses of seedlings to drought stress include increased chlorophyll content, for example in Acacia catechu, and root biomass, as in several dry forest species (for example Drypetes parvifolia, Teclia verdoornia) of Ghana. Mulching, application of fertilizers, interplanting of leguminous species and mycorrhizal inoculation are useful tools for promoting seedling establishment in nutrient-poor dry tropical soils. Periodic forest fires, and predation affect recruitment and seedling development according to their intensity. Many species experiencing frequent fires have evolved thick seed coats, produce fire-hardy seedling, or escape the effect by temporal separation of seed dispersal and fire events. Predation may result in abortion of fruits or may enhance germination and recruitment by scarification and dispersal, as in most species of the Guanacaste dry forest. Exposure to elevated CO2 has increased relative growth rate, total leaf area and water use efficiency in most of the dry tropical seedling tested, but the magnitude of the effect has varied markedly among species. Due to the availability of a large source of energy, large seeds show higher germination percentage, greatet seddling survival and increased growth. Seeds originating from different provenances exhibit differences in germination and seedling growth (for example Prosopis cineraria, Albizia lebbeck, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Acacia mangium), efficiency of nodulation (for example Acacia nilotica, A. auriculiformis), and stress resistance (for example Populus deltoides, Dalbergia sissoo). The review points out the need for coordinated, long-term, field-based studies for identification of multiple cues and niches for germination, on seed and seedling dynamics in response to fire, and on within-species genetic variability for selection of suitable provenances.Field-based studies at species and community levels are also needed to permit manipulations of biotic components to augment the recruitment of desired species and to suppress that of undesirable species.;;;;;;;;;91;4;85;9;101;0376-8929;;WOS:000168502300004;

The growth response of seedlings of A. procera from seeds of different sizes was studied under four soil water levels. Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated and grown in a glasshouse for 3 weeks under optimal water supply, and were subsequently maintained at four soil water levels for 4 months. Soil matric potentials for 1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 water holding capacity (WHC) were -0.01, -0.1, -0.61 and -1.20 MPa. respectively. Plant height, stem diameter and leaf area were measured fortnightly. Seedlings were harvested at the end of the experiment. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), stem weight ratio (SWR), root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were determined. Seedlings from large seeds had a higher biomass and leaf area and were more tolerant of long-term extreme water stress compared to those from small seeds which were more tolerant of moderate levels of water stress. Seedlings from small seeds did not survive beyond 75 d at 1/4 WHC. Increase in the R:S ratio along with a decrease in SWR reflected a shift in biomass allocation from above- to below-ground parts as soil water level decreased. SLA declined sharply with increasing water stress, which in turn led to a decrease in RGR. NAR increased with water stress. The study revealed the ability of the species to acclimate to a wide range of moisture stress by morphogenetic (increased R:S ratio and decreased SWR) and physiological (increased NAR) plastic responses.

With a greenhouse experiment we investigated these relationships by examining responses of growth, growth-related morphology, survival, and their interrelationships to a range of nitrogen (3.4 x 10(-9)-3.4 x 10(-3) mol/L N fertilizer solutions) and low light (0.6-7.3% of open sky) availabilities for young seedlings of 10 North American toe species that vary in observational shade tolerance rankings and seed size (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Betula alleghaniensis, Acer saccharum, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana. Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea).Within all species, relative growth rate (RGR) and survival increased with light. RGR and survival also increased with N supply but only at the two highest light levels, and then only for the shade-intolerant, broad-leaved Populus and Betula spp.. In every species, survival was positively related to RGR. Moreover, each species differed in the relationship of survival to RGR, and these differences were related to seed mass: at any given RGR, large-seeded, shade-tolerant species had higher survival than smaller-seeded, intolerant ones.Across species, in most light and N treatments, seed mass was positively related to young seedling survival, but RGR was not. In very low light the relative benefits of greater seed mass to survival were temporary. As seedlings aged, interspecific mortality rates became more dependent on observational shade tolerance rankings than on seed size, but mortality was still unrelated to RGR.Our results indicate potentially important interactions among light, N, and species that could influence regeneration dynamics. For young seedlings in deeply shaded microsites, N supply does not matter, and only shade-tolerant species survive due, in part, to large seeds and physiological traits other than RGR. In moderate shade, RGR is greater, and survival is high for all species, except that small-seeded, broad-leaved, intolerant species have low survival and RGR at low N supply. This suggests that broad-leaved shade-intolerant species compete more effectively in moderate shade on richer soils than on poorer soils. Although we found that both seed mass and vegetative physiology influenced survival in shade, they did nor covary tightly, suggesting that they are under somewhat separate selection pressures.;;;;;;;;;149;7;148;2;163;d_c-58;;WOS:000088214400011;

This was done across 50 Australian species varying in seed reserve mass by eight orders of magnitude during the first week after germination. Proportional increase in hypocotyl length in shade compared to light was similar across the range of seed reserve mass. Etiolation did not lead to increase in hypocotyl length per wet mass, in other words, etiolated hypocotyls were not thinner. However, hypocotyl length per dry mass did increase, more so in smaller-seeded species. Thus, part of the hypocotyl elongation was because of increased water content, which would increase vulnerability to loss of turgor. There was also reallocation of dry matter from root to hypocotyl, again more so in smaller-seeded species, which would decrease anchorage strength and increase vulnerability to soil drying. Results were very similar when considered as correlated evolutionary divergences, compared to the cross-species patterns. The higher-risk etiolation behavior of smaller-seeded species can be understood through their having little to lose. Because they hold less reserve resource uncommitted and attempt a faster initial growth rate, their chances of sustained longevity in shade below the compensation point are very low.;;;;;;;;;17;1;14;1;18;0003-0147;;WOS:000083814000007;

The inhibition of growth at higher irradiance was greater in the more shade-tolerant species.4 Data from growth analyses were used in a principal components analysis to quantify the species' positions on a light response gradient. The growth variables most strongly correlated with this gradient were relative growth rate (RGR) and relative diameter growth in 2% irradiance, and also apparent quantum efficiency and leaf mortality rate in both 2% and 66% irradiance. These results draw attention to the importance of performance in deep forest shade in defining differences among tropical forest tree species.5 The second (independent) axis of the principal components analysis separated three species that are known from other experiments to be drought tolerant. Other species' traits of functional significance (adult deciduousness, seed size, seed dispersal) were only weakly, if at all, associated with the gradient of light response.6 Possible methods for efficient placement of other species on the gradient of light response are discussed.

Seedlings were grown under controlled, favourable conditions and measurements were made for various growth, morphological and allocation traits.2 Trait correlations across all species were identified, particularly with respect to seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA), a fundamental measure of allocation strategy that reflects the light-capture area deployed per unit of photosynthate invested in leaves.3 Across all species, SLA, specific root length (SRL) and seed reserve mass were the strongest predictors of seedling RGR. That is, a syndrome of leaf and root surface maximization and low seed mass was typical of high RGR plants. This may be a high-risk strategy for individual seedlings, but one presumably mitigated by a larger number of seedlings being produced, increasing the chance that at least one will find itself in a favourable situation.4 Syndromes of repeated attribute divergence were identified in the two sets of gradient PICs. Species from lower resource habitats generally had lower SLA. Thus, in this important respect the two gradients appeared to be variants of a more general 'stress' gradient.5 However, trends in biomass allocation, tissue density, root morphology and seed reserve mass differed between gradients. While SLA and RGR tended to shift together along gradients and in within-habitat PICs, no single attribute emerged as the common, primary factor driving RGR divergences within contrasts. Within-habitat attribute shifts were of similar magnitude to those along gradients.;;;;;;;;;161;7;157;0;170;0022-0477;;WOS:000078762300008;

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.";;;;;;;;;46;3;45;0;50;d_c-58;;WOS:000076300200007;

There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature.2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates.3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.;;;;;;;;;125;11;126;1;143;0269-8463;;WOS:000076276900009;

The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span.2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light.3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA; SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span.4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.";;;;;;;;;217;3;196;1;225;0269-8463;;WOS:000074764200001;

To test several hypotheses about acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis and respiration to differing light conditions, we investigated the interspecific relationships between leaf and root metabolism, chemistry and morphology in high and low light conditions for young seedlings of nine boreal tree species that differ in relative growth rate (RGR).2. Light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(sat)), whole-plat nitrogen (N) uptake rates, leaf and root respiration and morphology, and RGR all varied in parallel among the nine species when grown in both 5% and 25% of full sunlight. RGR, A(sat), leaf and root respiration (R-d), and N uptake rate per unit root mass or length differed significantly among species, ranking (from high to low): Populus, Betula and Larix SPP (all deciduous) and then to five evergreen conifers (Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp,), which were generally comparable in these measures.3, A(sat), leaf and root R-d and N uptake rates were all correlated (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9) with species traits, such as seed mass, leaf life span and shade-tolerance rankings. Mass-based A(sat) was greater in conifer seedlings raised in low than high light. In contrast, area-based A(sat) was higher for plants grown in high than low light, especially in the deciduous species. Once adjusted for differences in plant mass, leaf or root respiration rates did not differ for plants grown in low vs high light.4, Interspecific variation in RGR was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with rates of photosynthesis, respiration and N uptake. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates were correlated to specific leaf area and leaf N concentrations (r approximate to 0.9). Root respiraristi rates, N uptake rates, specific root length (root length per root dry mass) and root N concentrations were all highly correlated with each other (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9). These data suggest a close coupling of tissue-level metabolism, chemistry and structure with whole-plant performance and species ecophysiological and life-history traits.;;;;;;;;;214;15;200;4;237;0269-8463;;WOS:000074764200009;
Seedmass;J;Westoby, M;;;;;;;;A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme;;;;;;;;PLANT AND SOIL;;;;199;2;;;213;227;;10.1023/A:1004327224729;;;FEB 1998;1998;"A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes.The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C-S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance.A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region.The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance.The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.";;;;;;;;;477;43;458;6;537;0032-079X;;WOS:000073701100005;

We studied ten species, which differed by 30-fold in relative growth rate (RGR). We analyzed plant growth in two contrasting light levels during 52 days and two transfers: from high to low (HL) and from low to high (LH) light intensity, and the respective controls in high (HH) and low (LL) light for another 52 days. The photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance were measured at the day of the transfer between light conditions and at the end of the experiment. Species with high RGR showed the largest changes in RGR in response to contrasting light conditions (HH/LL ratio), and species with low RGR showed low responses. The fast-growing species were the most plastic, followed by species with intermediate growth rates, with the slow-growing species being the least plastic. Fast-growing species achieved higher maximum photosynthetic capacities (A(max)) and stomatal conductance and higher response to light than slow-growing species. Species with high RGR showed a low RGR HH/LH ratio, suggesting a large response of L plants when transfered to H. The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35-75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpinia eriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendron mexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.";;;;;;;;;44;5;46;1;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000071009200006;

In 1982 provenance trials were initiated to evaluate the performance of 11 provenances in three experimental sites: De Hoek in the northeastern Transvaal; Frankfort in the eastern Transvaal; and Witfontein in the southern Cape. Only five provenances were planted in all three sites. The great variation in fruit and seed mass could not be related to latitudinal or locality differences of origin of the provenances. Germination capacity ranged between 3 and 94%, but the differences were related to periodically unsuitable environmental conditions during fertilisation of the ovule rather than genetic variation. For most provenances the germination rate over time followed the normal pattern of a sharp increase in germination during October, about 50 weeks after sowing. However, seed from the sub tropical Zululand coast germinated after 10 weeks and continued to germinate without a dormancy period, which suggested a genetic shift with adaptation to the warm, moist conditions along the coast. Tree growth rate showed much promise. At De Hoek the Wonderwoud provenance, the closest source area, performed best with mean DBH of 14,2 cm and mean height of 8,2 m for the 25 tallest trees after 11 years. At Frankfort the Mariepskop provenance, the closest source area, performed best with mean DBH of 10,5 cm and mean height of 8,2 m for the tallest 10 trees after 11 years. At Witfontein the Amatole forest provenances performed best with mean DBH of 9,0 cm and mean height of 5,6 m for the tallest 15 trees after 8,5 years. MAI-20years for P. falcatus Woodbush provenance at De Hoek was calculated as 5,8 m-3/ha compared to 17,3 m-3/ha for Pinus elliottii for the De Hoek plantation. The monetary value of the timber of P. falcatus at age 20 years is, however, higher than that of the timber of P. elliottii. Several recommendations are made: the three experimental plantings should be maintained with application of appropriate silvicultural treatment; for future commercial plantings seed should be collected from several trees of good form and vigour in the immediate source area of the planting site; clonal gains trials should be established for demonstration purposes and to obtain information on which top selections are clonally repeatable; if commercial plantings are to be continued, studies should be initiated on water use of the species, genetic variation of ecotypes of the species, and variation in timber properties of the provenances.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;BCI:BCI199799564660;

Overall mortality in deep shade (0.3, 1.6%) was considerably lower in Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus catharticus, Viburnum lantana and V. opulus. Average mortality in deep shade on grassland soil was negatively correlated with embryo-cum-endosperm dry mass (EEM). Overall mortality in deep shade was significantly greater with higher nutrient supply.3 In 63% daylight relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively correlated with log EEM, and positively with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) at time of planting but not at final harvest, i.e. differences in RGR were determined more by unit leaf rate (rate of dry mass gain/leaf area) in the latter part of the experiment.4 The responses of the species to irradiance and nutrient supply were appreciably different. Cornus, Ligustrum, Prunus spinosa, Rhamnus, and Rosa increased yield strongly under high irradiance on nutrient-poor soil, and responded also markedly to nutrients. Viburnum lantana and Euonymus grew relatively slowly in all treatments, but the former was responsive to nutrients, even in deep shade. Viburnum opulus was more responsive to irradiance but responded to nutrients only in 11% daylight. Crataegus grew more slowly on its 'own' soil than on grassland soil. Juniperus differed consistently from the other species, growing slowly, and responding strongly to irradiance. Fagus responded moderately to irradiance and not to nutrient supply.5 In shade allocation to roots decreased, while allocation to stem and to leaves increased generally. All species produced a smaller number and total area of leaves, and increased SLA and leaf area ratio (leaf area/total dry mass). Shoot and root lengths were reduced in shade.6 The results are discussed in relation to the roles of the various species during secondary succession, and their regeneration niches.;;;;;;;;;116;7;106;1;123;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996WB58300003;

At cotyledon stage (i.e. when placed in dense shade from germination onwards), species with larger seed mass tended to survive longer. This was true within 11 phylogenetically independent contrast (PIG) pairs of plant species, as well as across all 22 species.2 RGR of early seedlings in full light (to day 10 after germination), and cotyledon dark respiration, were measured as potential indicators of the speed with which metabolic resources in the seed were used during early seedling development. These indicators proved not to be such good predictors of longevity under dense shade as was seed mass itself.3 Seedlings were also grown in the light until five days after true leaves appeared, before being transferred to dense shade. The different behaviour of these true-leaf seedlings was consistent with the idea that extra resources in seeds are the direct cause of longer dense-shade survival. Longevity in dense shade at leaf stage was often shorter than for cotyledon-stage seedlings, especially for larger-seeded species: Longevity in dense shade at leaf stage was best correlated with a slow potential RGR in full light measured over days 10-30 of growth. Correlation with seed mass was marginal and probably an indirect correlation via RGR, and there was no correlation with leaf dark respiration.;;;;;;;;;81;6;76;1;90;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996VU80400005;

Treatments included absence and presence of litter in the forest understory, a small gap, and a large gap. Seedling emergence of large-seeded species Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata and Acer mono was not reduced by accumulation of litter in the forest understory, but was promoted in the large gap where litter was less. Seedling emergence of small-seeded species, Alnus hirsuta, Cercidiphyllum japonicum and Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was reduced by the litter in almost all of the sites. Seedlings of large-seeded species avoid shade stress phenologically by unfolding all of their large leaves in a short period before canopy closure in the forest understory. These species had little mortality after seedling emergence. In contrast, small-seeded species have a longer duration of leaf emergence, shorter leaf longevity, and rapid leaf turnover in all the sites. These seedlings attained similar height to those of the large-seeded species at the end of the second year in the large gap, but survival and height growth rate decreased after canopy closure in the forest understory. We suggest that the importance of seed size in determining seedling establishment largely depends on the relationships between seasonal changes of environmental conditions and phenological traits of seedlings, which are related to seed size.;;;;;;;;;84;1;83;1;91;0042-3106;;WOS:A1996UE17800004;

Daytime temperatures were very high during the field experiment and even the most favourable watering treatment showed quite low rates of emergence and survival. This low survival may have reduced the ability to detect a greater advantage of large seeds over small seeds under drier than under better- watered conditions.3 In the glasshouse, the difference in survival from emergence between seedlings from small and large seeds increased under increasingly dry soil conditions, thus supporting the hypothesis. In addition, survival time of seedlings under drying soil conditions was positively associated with seed size.4 The difference in the field results compared with the glasshouse experiment suggests that although large seeds do provide an advantage for seedlings establishing in low soil moisture conditions, this may be realized only under particular field conditions, depending on the characteristics of the rainfall event and the soil conditions. Thus, only a subset of establishment events may provide selection pressure for large seed size.;;;;;;;;;166;17;173;1;193;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NV17600004;

Plants were kept in a shade house for a period of 15 months at 37%, 10% and 2.5% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), roughly corresponding to light environments in large gaps, small gaps, and forest understorey, respectively. The species were chosen to represent a wide array of taxa, ecological, and morphological characteristics, and were assigned regeneration niche (RN) index values based on observations of life history and spatial distribution of their seedlings and saplings in various forest microsites.2 Growth, biomass allocation patterns, leaf anatomy and stomatal responses varied appreciably among species, as well as in response to shading. All species showed reduced growth with decreasing light intensity. Plants grown at 37% and 10% PAR exhibited morphological and physiological responses typical of plants found at forest edges and in large gaps: i.e. low leaf area ratio (LAR), high specific leaf weight (SLW), high root-shoot ratio (RSR), high relative growth rate (RGR), high net assimilation rate (NAR), high leaf conductance, and high chlorophyll a/b ratio. Those grown at 2.5% PAR showed the opposite trends. Comparing species within each light level, NAR and LAR showed positive correlation with RGR, but pooled data for all light levels suggests that the contribution of LAR and NAR to RGR are in opposite directions, depending on light conditions.3 Sensitivity of seedling growth to shading was significantly correlated with mean seed reserve weight of the species: small-seeded species were more affected than large-seeded ones. Relationship between seed reserve weight and species RN index value, though linear, was weak and nonsignificant. RGR was significantly correlated with seed reserve weight at 37% and 10% PAR but not at 2.5% PAR, while LAR showed the opposite trend.4 Plasticity of most parameters examined appeared highest in species that regenerate mostly in large gaps (> 200 m2) and at forest edges, and least in species that regenerate mostly in forest understorey and small gaps (< 50 m2). However, ordination of the study species, using seed size and various shade tolerance criteria for the seedlings, yielded a continuum rather than discrete groups. The first axis, which explained most of the variation (65.6%), was influenced by NAR, RGR, stomatal conductance and total biomass, and was strongly correlated with species regeneration status.;;;;;;;;;113;9;112;7;133;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NL94400016;

The root, bole and crown zones of such gaps provide very different conditions of nutrient input and root competition and, therefore, should favor trees with different early growth forms and nutrient requirements. The role of gaps in the maintenance of tree species richness is explored by outlining the major differences among the three zones of a single tree-fall gap, demonstrating the high rates of invasions of these gaps by tree seedlings, and predicting the phenotypic traits of seeds and seedlings that should best adapt them to conditions in the different zones. Traits examined include seed size, allocation of cotyledonary reserves, shade tolerance, vertical growth rate, wood density (mechanical strength), armament, branching, leaf layering, leaf orientation, leaf construction and longevity, petioles and mycorrhizal associations. The potential roles of gap size, season of formation, and species of tree that formed the gap are also considered. Tree falls in the temperate zone probably do not have the same effect on tree species richness because of the conditions of tree fall (trunk snapping, falling in winter when no leaves are present), the greater nutrient reserves in temperate forest soils, and the importance of windstorms and fire in temperate forests.;;;;;;;;;105;3;99;3;112;0564-3295;;BCI:BCI198477017955;

This makes possible a computation of the presumable rate of growth between successive collections of seeds from the same tree. During differentiation, the av. growth rate is about 1/2 stage per day. It is somewhat slower in the largest, much slower in the smallest seeds. At the time of shoot-tip differentiation and cotyledon initiation, the vol. of the embryo is closely related to the vol. of endosperm and seed. There exists a correlation among seed size, embryo size, and number of cotyledons. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ";;;;;;;;;13;0;9;0;13;;;BCI:BCI19472100012358;

Functional groups of species may differ in any of these traits, potentially resulting in (1) differences in mean RGR of groups, and (2) differences in the traits driving RGR variation within each group. We tested these predictions by comparing deciduous and evergreen savanna trees.Methods RGR, changes to biomass allocation and leaf morphology, and root non-structural carbohydrate reserves were evaluated for juveniles of 51 savanna species (34 deciduous, 17 evergreen) grown in a common garden experiment. It was anticipated that drivers of RGR would differ between leaf habit groups because deciduous species have to allocate carbohydrates to storage in roots to be able to flush leaves again, which directly compromises their LMF, whereas evergreen species are not subject to this constraint.Key Results Evergreen species had greater LMF and RGR than deciduous species. Among deciduous species LMF explained 27% of RGR variation (SLA 34% and NAR 29 %), whereas among evergreen species LMF explained between 2 and 17% of RGR variation (SLA 32-35% and NAR 38-62 %). RGR and LMF were (negatively) related to carbohydrate storage only among deciduous species.Conclusions Trade-offs between investment in carbohydrate reserves and growth occurred only among deciduous species, leading to differences in relative contribution made by the underlying components of RGR between the leaf habit groups. The results suggest that differences in drivers of RGR occur among savanna species because these have different selected strategies for coping with fire disturbance in savannas. It is expected that variation in the drivers of RGR will be found in other functional types that respond differently to particular disturbances.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0305-7364;;WOS:000340434200011;24958787

The mean values of functional traits and soil environmental factors for each species that were related to RGR varied with ontogenetic stage. Sapling RGR showed greater relationships with functional traits than large-tree RGR, whereas large-tree RGR was more associated with soil environment than was sapling RGR. The strongest single predictors of RGR were wood density for saplings and slope aspect for large trees. The stepwise regression model for large trees accounted for a larger proportion of variability (R (2) = 0.95) in RGR than the model for saplings (R (2) = 0.55). Functional diversity analysis revealed that the process of habitat filtering likely contributes to the substantial changes in regulation of RGR as communities transition from saplings to large trees.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0029-8549;;WOS:000339893600025;24938832

However, the benefits of resprouting (survival) may be traded off against height growth and reproduction. Resources (total non-structural carbohydrates-TNC) that could be allocated to growth or reproduction are stored or mobilised to support resprouting. TNC may either be stored by accumulation where availability exceeds the requirements for growth, or by reserve formation when storage is at the expense of growth. Thus, the mechanism of storage and resource allocation may differ between good (R+) and poor (R-) resprouters in response to nutrient availability and disturbance regime. R+ species typically reserve resources to ensure a rapid resprouting response to disturbance. We test whether R+ and R- species in coastal forest, under chronic wind disturbance, differ in growth rates, biomass allocation, leaf traits, water relations and storage of TNC. Seedlings from three confamilial pairs of R+ and R- tree species were subjected to nitrogen addition, water stress and clipping (simulating herbivory) treatments under greenhouse conditions. R- species had greater height growth rates, larger specific leaf area, lower root mass ratio and lower root TNC than R+ species. These differences between R+ and R- species were maintained irrespective of the levels of nitrogen, water and clipping treatments. R+ species did not increase their TNC concentration under nutrient and water stress, indicating that TNC is stored by reserve formation. R+ species appeared to trade-off growth against storage, while R- species did not. In R+ species, reserve formation is likely a bet-hedging strategy against occasional strong selection events in addition to chronic wind stress. By trading off height growth for better resprouting ability, good resprouters may be able to persist at more frequently disturbed sites (e.g., dune crests and windward slopes), while poor resprouters that have faster height growth can dominate less disturbed sites.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0269-7653;;WOS:000336978700010;

Several functional traits have been shown to correlate with growth and mortality rates in trees, but less is known about how the relationships between functional traits and demographic rates change with tree size.We examined the associations of functional traits with growth and mortality across 43 tree species in the Fushan 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot in northern Taiwan. We estimated the 95th percentile maximum stem diameter, wood density and six leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, succulence, and mass-based nitrogen and phosphorus contents) obtained from leaves on juvenile and adult individuals of each species.To quantify size-dependent changes in growth and mortality, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality were estimated as a function of stem diameter using hierarchical Bayesian models. These rate estimates were then correlated with functional traits at a range of stem diameter classes.Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates varied with tree size. Maximum size was positively correlated with RGR across a wide range of tree sizes. Wood density was negatively correlated with RGR and mortality for small-sized trees. Leaf traits such as leaf area and specific leaf area at juvenile and adult stages were associated more strongly with demographic rates for corresponding sizes than from other sizes.Synthesis. The observed size-dependent changes in the trait-demography relationships are possibly due to the effects of developmental and environmental changes with increasing tree size. The underlying effects of functional traits on demographic performance vary with tree size, and this should influence dynamics in a tree community.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0022-0477;;WOS:000334588300010;

We evaluated growth, survival, and ecophysiological responses of four native and four invasive species in a greenhouse experiment that simulated reduced light and water conditions commonly found in invaded field conditions. Our results show that light is a more important limiting resource than water for all species. Specifically, values for photosynthesis, light compensation point, light saturation point, stomatal conductance, leaf mass per area, relative growth rate, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency were all greater under high-light conditions than they were under low-light conditions. In contrast, water limitation negatively affected only stomatal conductance and delta C-13. Our results also show that responses to light were species-specific rather than related to whether species were native or nonnative. We also tested restoration potential of top-performing native species under field conditions in a Hawaiian lowland wet forest by comparing relative growth and mortality rates in both invaded (low-light) plots and in plots from which invasive species had been removed (high-light conditions). Of the native species, Myrsine lessertiana and Psychotria hawaiiensis had highest survival and growth rates in low-light plots after 4 yr, and Metrosideros polymorpha showed 100% mortality under the same conditions. Under low light, M. lessertiana and P. hawaiiensis survived and grew at rates similar to those of invasive species in both field and greenhouse and thus represent suitable candidates for restoration in invaded Hawaiian lowland wet forests.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0030-8870;;WOS:000336238400007;

Leaf expansion in both the groups was, in general, completed before June (i.e. well before the onset of monsoon rains). Although leaf dry mass during leaf initiation phase was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in evergreen species than in deciduous species, at the time of full leaf expansion, average leaf dry mass relative to the peak leaf dry mass, realised by the evergreen species was lower (66 %) than for deciduous species (76 %). Leaf dry mass increase in both groups continued after leaf full expansion. Evergreen species had a longer leaf dry mass steady phase than deciduous species (2-6 vs 2-3 months). Average LMA of mature leaves for evergreen species (77.43 g m(-2)) was significantly greater than that of deciduous species (48.43 g m(-2)). LL ranged from 165 days in Gmelina arborea (deciduous) to 509 days in Dipterocarpus turbinatus (evergreen). LMA was correlated positively with LL, indicating that evergreen species with higher leaf construction cost retain leaves for longer period to pay back. The average leaf dry mass loss before leaf shedding was greater (P < 0.01) for deciduous species (30.29 %) than for evergreen species (18.31 %). Although the cost of leaf construction in deciduous species was lower than for evergreen species, they replace leaves at a faster rate. Deciduous species perhaps compensate the cost involved in faster leaf replacement through higher reabsorption of dry mass during senescence, which they remobilise to initiate growth in the following spring when soil resources remain limiting.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0912-3814;;WOS:000333157400006;

Consequently, we observed good height growth of both species in CON and INT, but fir surpassed spruce in SMA and LAR. Results suggest that intermediate 100-300 m(2) irregular openings create microenvironmental conditions that may promote short-term ecophysiology and growth of red spruce, allowing the species to compete with balsam fir advance regeneration.

On account of this directional selection, we hypothesized that tree populations growing near their upper cold elevational limits exhibit lower phenotypic plasticity of growth and leaf morphological traits in response to temperature changes than populations growing at lower elevations.Seedlings of six common deciduous tree species originating from low and high elevations were transplanted into eight common gardens along two elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the genetic differentiation in growth and leaf morphology between populations from low and high elevations and to quantify the phenotypic plasticity of these traits to temperature changes.In contrast to growth that decreased with increasing elevation, leaf mass per area (LMA) showed no significant change with elevation of common garden, except for a decrease in Laburnum alpinum for both low- and high-elevation provenances. Interestingly, leaf density was found to decrease with elevation of the gardens for all species. Genetic differentiation between low- and high-elevation populations was found in both leaf morphology and growth: high-elevation populations tended to have slower growth rate than low-elevation populations, while no consistent trend was found for LMA across species. Interestingly, for Acer pseudoplatanus and Fraxinus excelsior high-elevation populations exhibited a lower phenotypic plasticity of growth in response to temperature compared to lower populations, whereas no interactions between the elevation of a provenance and the elevation of the garden was detected for the four other species.Hence, during young life stages, the expected increase in tree growth in future warmer climates might be lower in populations living in the coldest part of the species distribution range in temperate species such as Acer pseudoplatanus and Fraxinus excelsior, but similar in other tree species, disregarding other environmental changes.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0269-8463;;WOS:000331083900024;

Growth, survivorship and recruitment in four A.muelleri populations were monitored across 9 years. Demographic rates were analysed using stage-based transition matrices. Leaf C-13, %N and photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) were measured for seedlings, saplings and trees, and leaf mass per area (LMA) for trees, and correlations among ecophysiological and demographic variables explored. Seedling, sapling and tree stem growth were among the slowest, and annual survivorship among the highest, reported for any tree. Transition matrix analyses yielded stable estimated population growth rates, , not significantly different from 1.0 for all populations. Leaf C-13 was positively correlated with seedling and sapling height growth, while daytime photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) was high in seedlings, but low in saplings and trees. Ecophysiological measures suggest that individuals transition from moisture-limited growth at the seedling stage to nutrient-limited growth as adults. High levels of environmental stress result in slow stand dynamics, characterized by low recruitment and growth rates counterbalanced by equally low mortality rates. These dynamics result in populations with limited capacity to increase in size quickly, but potentially highly vulnerable to decline should the rate of adult mortality increase. This combination of traits is likely typical of extreme stress-tolerator woody species and suggests a conservation focus on the preservation of mature individuals.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1442-9985;;WOS:000330263300006;

An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.;;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;5;0027-8424;;WOS:000329614500046;24379395

Two canopy species with contrasting functional traits dominating early and late successional stages, respectively, in a tropical montane rain forest of Hainan Island, China, were selected in a pot experiment under 4 levels of light intensity (full, 50%, 30%, and 10%) in order to explore the adaptive strategies of tropical trees to light conditions. Under each light intensity level, the pioneer species, Endospermum chinense (Euphorbiaceae), had higher relative growth rate (RGR), stem mass ratio (SMR), specific leaf area (SLA), and morphological plasticity while the shade tolerant climax species, Parakmeria lotungensis (Magnoliaceae), had higher root mass ratio (RMR) and leaf mass ratio (LMR). RGR of both species was positively related to SMR and SLA under each light level but was negatively correlated with RMR under lower light (30% and 10% full light). The climax species increased its survival by a conservative resource use strategy through increasing leaf defense and root biomass investment at the expense of growth rate in low light. In contrast, the pioneer increased its growth by an exploitative resource use strategy through increasing leaf photosynthetic capacity and stem biomass investment at the expense of survival under low light. There was a trade-off between growth and survival for species under different light conditions. Our study suggests that tree species in the tropical rainforest adopt different strategies in stands of different successional stages. Species in the earlier successional stages have functional traits more advantageous to grow faster in the high light conditions, whereas species in the late successional stages have traits more favorable to survive in the low light conditions.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;MEDLINE:25019095;25019095

Little is known about how the growth versus shade tolerance trade-off interacts with other major trade-offs associated with differential adaptation to major environmental factors besides light. We asked whether the growth versus shade tolerance trade-off differed between subtropical rainforest tree assemblages native to basaltic (fertile) and rhyolitic (infertile) soils in northern New South Wales, because of the allocational costs of adaptation to low nutrient availability. Seedling relative growth rates of six basalt specialists and five rhyolite specialists were measured in a glasshouse and the minimum light requirements of each species were quantified in the field by determining the 10th percentile of juvenile tree distributions in relation to understorey light availability. A similar range of light requirements was observed in the two assemblages, and although the two fastest growing species were basalt specialists, seedling growth rates did not differ significantly between the two substrates. The overall relationship between light requirements and growth rate was weak, and there was no compelling evidence that the slope or elevation of this relationship differed between the two assemblages. Growth rates were significantly correlated, overall, with specific leaf area, and marginally with leaf area ratio. The apparent similarity of the growth versus shade tolerance trade-off in the two suites of species could reflect effects of leaf nutrient content on respiration rates; basalt specialists tended to have a smaller root mass fraction, but this may have been offset by the effects of leaf nitrogen status on respiration rates, with higher respiration rates expected on fertile basaltic soils. However, the results might also partly reflect impairment of the field performance of two basalt specialists that were heavily attacked by natural enemies.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0067-1924;;WOS:000335518200005;

Resprouting has been discussed from two adaptation perspectives: recovery from damage by catastrophic disturbance and survival in frequently disturbed shaded understorey. However, few studies have comprehensively dealt with both adaptation types to understand resprouting strategies. To understand the adaptive significance of resprouting, we assessed the size dependence of resprouting ability after stem clipping for 24 deciduous broad-leaved species, including shrubs, sub-canopy and canopy trees, in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The community assembly includes species adapted to past catastrophic disturbances (e.g. fire, logging) and to stable forest with intermittent treefall (currently the dominant disturbance). We correlated resprouting ability with life-history strategies based on demographic parameters and plant functional traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness and wood density. All the studied species could resprout in juveniles, and resprouting ability increased as stump size increased. Most sub-canopy and canopy trees lost their ability to resprout after attaining a particular stump size, whereas shrub species retained the ability to resprout throughout their lifetimes. The relative growth rate, LMA and foliar nitrogen did not greatly influence the resprouting ability of a species. In contrast, species with smaller maximum size, lower leaf toughness and lower wood density had better juvenile resprouting ability. This better resprouting ability may have evolved because these characteristics make them more vulnerable to shaded understorey. However, species with larger maximum size and lower leaf toughness retained their ability to resprout to a larger size.Synthesis. A better resprouting ability is related to the ability to survive frequent disturbances, in juveniles, which are characteristics of both forest understorey and frequent fire or drought. To retain resprouting ability until grown seems to be an adaptation to survive infrequent large disturbances. Light-demanding species, which generally have better resprouting ability than shade-tolerants both in juveniles and adults, are adapted to disturbances of various scale and frequency; however, shade-tolerants could survive well in the understorey due to a combination of stronger physical defences and resprouting ability.";;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0022-0477;;WOS:000328555600023;

The competitive response and effect of each species was quantified, and regressed against several functional traits to determine which traits are predictive of competitive ability.ResultsWe found that neighbour density negatively affected the survival of mesic tree seedlings but not humid tree seedlings. Mesic plants were able to maintain their relative growth rates (RGRs) despite increasing neighbourhood competition. The RGRs of humid species significantly decreased as the density of neighbours increased, indicating that competition may be a factor affecting plants in savannas receiving more than 650mm mean annual rainfall. We used the quantile regression method to show that the biomass of humid tree seedlings decreased with increased neighbour biomass, when considering competitive response only. We also found that resource-acquiring traits (such as maximum RGR, plant height and root biomass) were positively correlated with the competitive effect of mesic savanna seedlings, while specific leaf area captured the competitive response of humid savanna seedlings to neighbour competition.ConclusionsCompetitive interactions between savanna trees negatively affect survival and growth rate, although the competitive effect or response of a particular species depends on its adaptation to either high- or low-resource environments. Our results show significant relationships between plant traits and competitive ability, which may be used to predict competitive interactions between tree seedlings from humid and mesic savannas.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1100-9233;;WOS:000328544600022;

They have also been hypothesized to possess a set of traits associated with fast growth, resource uptake and high productivity.In this review, these hypotheses are evaluated by assembling and synthesizing published and unpublished data sets from across the globe concerning resource allocation, growth rates and traits of leaves, stems and roots of climbers and self-supporting species.The majority of studies offer little support for the smaller allocation of biomass to stems or greater relative growth rates in climbers; however, these results are based on small sized (1 kg) plants. Simulations based on allometric biomass equations demonstrate, however, that larger lianas allocate a greater fraction of above-ground biomass to leaves (and therefore less biomass to stems) compared with similar sized trees. A survey of leaf traits of lianas revealed their lower average leaf mass per area (LMA), higher N and P concentration and a slightly higher mass-based photosynthetic rate, as well as a lower concentration of phenolic-based compounds than in woody self-supporting species, consistent with the specialization of lianas towards the fast metabolism/rapid turnover end of the global trait spectra. Liana stems have an efficient hydraulic design and unique mechanical features, while roots appear to penetrate deeper soil levels than in trees and are often able to generate hydraulic pressure. Much remains to be learned, however, about these and other functional specializations of their axial organs and the associated trade-offs. Developmental switches between self-supporting, searcher and climbing shoots within the same individual are a promising field of comparative studies on trait association in lianas. Finally, some of the vast trait variability within lianas may be reduced when species with different climbing mechanisms are considered separately, and when phylogenetic conservatism is accounted for.";;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0305-7364;;WOS:000327717100003;24169592

We measured seedling growth of 17 New Zealand rain forest angiosperm trees in a glasshouse, as well as biomass partitioning, gas exchange and hydraulic traits. We then related these variables to the mean July (winter) minimum temperatures most frequently experienced throughout the range of each species. Species associated with mild winters on average had wider vessels and more conductive stems and were leafier (i.e. developed more foliage area per unit sapwood area) than species from frostier sites. Species' positions on the temperature gradient were not significantly correlated with relative growth rates of seedlings; they were, however, negatively correlated with two measures of species light requirements in the field: the light compensation point for growth, and low-light mortality rates obtained from the literature.Synthesis. Although seedling growth rates of warm- and cool-temperate New Zealand angiosperm trees were similar on average, the former are more shade tolerant. Competitive hierarchies associated with tree species sorting on temperature gradients thus probably involve a shift in the relationship between shade tolerance and growth rate, rather than a simple trade-off of growth with cold tolerance. This shift is associated with variation in light interception potential per unit of seedling biomass, possibly reflecting a trade-off between stem conductivity and resistance to freeze-thaw embolism.";;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0022-0477;;WOS:000325984300016;

Various aspen progenies (Populus tremula and P tremuloides) with different growth performance are used in short-rotation forestry. Hence, a better understanding of the link between root trait syndromes and the adaptation of a deme to a particular environment is essential in order to improve the match between planted varieties and their growth conditions. We examined the between-deme (genetic) and within-deme (mostly environmental) variation in important fine root traits [mean root diameter, specific root area (SRA) and specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RID), root tip abundance, root N concentration] and their co-variation with leaf traits [specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, leaf N concentration] in eight genetically distinct P tremula and P tremuloides demes. Five of the six root traits varied significantly between the demes with largest genotypic variation in root tip abundance and lowest in mean root diameter and RID (no significant difference). Within-deme variation in root morphology was as large as between-deme variation suggesting a relatively low genetic control. Significant relationships existed neither between SLA and SRA nor between leaf N and root N concentration in a plant. Contrary to expectation, high aboveground relative growth rates (RGR) were associated with large, and not small, fine root diameters with low SRA and SRL. Compared to leaf traits, the influence of root traits on RGR was generally low. We conclude that aspen exhibits large intraspecific variation in leaf and also in root morphological traits which is only partly explained by genetic distances. A root order-related analysis might give deeper insights into intraspecific root trait variation.;;;;;;;;;3;0;2;0;3;1664-462X;;WOS:000331441300001;24155751

Suites of correlated functional traits may reflect fundamental tradeoffs and general plant strategies and hence represent trait spectra along which plant species can vary according to their respective strategies. However, the functional interpretation of these trait spectra requires the inspection of their relation to plant performance. We employed principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) to quantify fundamental whole-plant trait spectra based on 23 traits for 305 North American woody species that span boreal to subtropical climates. We related the major axes of PCoA to five measures of plant performance (i.e., growth rate, and tolerance to drought, shade, water-logging and fire) for all species and separately for gymnosperms and angiosperms. Across all species a unified gymnosperm-angiosperm trait spectrum (wood density, seed mass, rooting habit) is identified, which is correlated with drought tolerance. Apart from this, leaf type and specific leaf area (SLA) strongly separate gymnosperms from angiosperms. For gymnosperms, one trait spectrum emerges (seed mass, rooting habit), which is positively correlated with drought tolerance and inversely with shade tolerance, reflecting a tradeoff between these two strategies due to opposing trait characteristics. Angiosperms are functionally more diverse. The trait spectra related to drought tolerance and shade tolerance are decoupled and three distinct strategies emerge: high drought tolerance (low SLA, dense wood, heavy seeds, taproot), high shade tolerance (high SLA, shallow roots, high toxicity, opposite arranged leaves), and fast growth/stress intolerance (large maximum heights, soft wood, light seeds, high seed spread rate). In summary, our approach reveals that complex suits of traits and potential tradeoffs underlie fundamental performance strategies in forests. Studies relying on small sets of plant traits may not be able to reveal such underlying strategies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;2150-8925;;WOS:000327380400011;

Regardless of species, higher height growth rate was observed at intermediate light levels (33-52% sunlight). Diameter growth rate, however, increased with increasing light level. Morphological variables (mean leaf area, total leaf area per plant, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio) were significantly affected by light, with greater variation occurring in deep shade treatment (6% sunlight). Total biomass increased with light levels for E. sylvestris, Q. phillyraeoides and G. jasminoides but larger biomass was found at intermediate light levels for I. henryi and A. crenata. Biomass allocation patterns displayed small variations in the five species. Although the five species differ in their growth strategy across a light gradient, their large plasticity allows them to grow well under a wide range of light environments. As a whole, E. sylvestris, Q phillyraeoides and G. jasminoides showed their best growth above 52% sunlight. Optimal light condition for I. henryi and A. crenata were from 33 to 52% sunlight.

Review and synthesis;;;;;;;;JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY;;;;64;13;;;4053;4080;;10.1093/jxb/ert316;;;oct-13;2013;"Leaf vein traits are implicated in the determination of gas exchange rates and plant performance. These traits are increasingly considered as causal factors affecting the leaf economic spectrum (LES), which includes the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, dark respiration, foliar nitrogen concentration, leaf dry mass per area (LMA) and leaf longevity. This article reviews the support for two contrasting hypotheses regarding a key vein trait, vein length per unit leaf area (VLA). Recently, Blonder et al. (2011, 2013) proposed that vein traits, including VLA, can be described as the origin of the LES by structurally determining LMA and leaf thickness, and thereby vein traits would predict LES traits according to specific equations. Careful re-examination of leaf anatomy, published datasets, and a newly compiled global database for diverse species did not support the vein origin hypothesis, and moreover showed that the apparent power of those equations to predict LES traits arose from circularity. This review provides a flux trait network hypothesis for the effects of vein traits on the LES and on plant performance, based on a synthesis of the previous literature. According to this hypothesis, VLA, while virtually independent of LMA, strongly influences hydraulic conductance, and thus stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate. We also review (i) the specific physiological roles of VLA; (ii) the role of leaf major veins in influencing LES traits; and (iii) the role of VLA in determining photosynthetic rate per leaf dry mass and plant relative growth rate. A clear understanding of leaf vein traits provides a new perspective on plant function independently of the LES and can enhance the ability to explain and predict whole plant performance under dynamic conditions, with applications towards breeding improved crop varieties.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0022-0957;;WOS:000325765000012;24123455

LMA can be explained by variation in leaf thickness and/ or density, both of which are infl uenced by anatomical tissue composition. The aim of this study is to quantify the anatomical characteristics that underlie variation in LMA in a range of woody species.Methods: Twenty-six woody species, forming 13 species pairs with a deciduous and evergreen species from the same genus or family, were grown in a glasshouse. The youngest full-grown leaves were analyzed for LMA and morpho-anatomical characteristics at leaf, tissue, and cell level.Key Results: Considered over all species studied, leaf thickness and density were equally important to explain the variation in LMA, but the class difference between deciduous and evergreen species was mainly determined by thickness, whereas variation within each group was largely due to density. Evergreens had thicker leaves, predominantly caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces, whereas the higher leaf density within each group was due to a lower proportion of epidermis and air spaces, and overall smaller cells.Conclusions: The anatomical basis for variation in LMA in woody species depends on the contrast made. Higher LMA in evergreens is mainly due to a greater leaf thickness, caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces. Within deciduous species and evergreens, higher LMA is caused by a higher density, due to higher volumetric fractions of mesophyll and lower fractions of air spaces and epidermis.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;1;f_vr-22;;WOS:000325712800005;24107583

This may be especially important for abiotic stresses such as salt inundation related to increased hurricane activity or sea level rise. If invasive species indeed have greater plasticity, this may reflect genetic differences between populations in the native and introduced ranges. Here, we examined plasticity of functional and fitness-related traits of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) populations from the introduced and native ranges that were grown along a gradient of soil salinity (control: 0 ppt; Low: 5 ppt; Medium: 10 ppt; High: 15 ppt) in a greenhouse. We used both norm reaction and plasticity index (PIv) to estimate the conspecific phenotypic plasticity variation between invasive and native populations. Overall, invasive populations had higher phenotypic plasticity of height growth rate (HGR), aboveground biomass, stem biomass and specific leaf area (SLA). The plasticity Index (PIv) of height growth rate (HGR) and SLA each were higher for plants from invasive populations. Absolute performance was always comparable or greater for plants from invasive populations versus native populations with the greatest differences at low stress levels. Our results were consistent with the ""Master-of-some"" pattern for invasive plants in which the fitness of introduced populations was greater in more benign conditions. This suggests that the greater conspecific phenotypic plasticity of invasive populations compared to native populations may increase invasion success in benign conditions but would not provide a potential interspecific competitive advantage in higher salinity soils that may occur with global climate change in coastal areas.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1932-6203;;WOS:000324481600153;24040366

However, while these mechanisms are usually considered separately, both may be involved in successful invasions. Biotic interactions may be positive or negative and may interact with nutritional resources in determining invasion success. In addition, the effects of different nutrients on invasions may vary. Finally, genetic variation in traits between populations located in introduced versus native ranges may be important for biotic interactions and/or resource use. Here, we investigated the roles of soil biota, resource availability, and plant genetic variation using seedlings of Triadica sebifera in an experiment in the native range (China). We manipulated nitrogen (control or 4 g/m(2)), phosphorus (control or 0.5 g/m(2)), soil biota (untreated or sterilized field soil), and plant origin (4 populations from the invasive range, 4 populations from the native range) in a full factorial experiment. Phosphorus addition increased root, stem, and leaf masses. Leaf mass and height growth depended on population origin and soil sterilization. Invasive populations had higher leaf mass and growth rates than native populations did in fresh soil but they had lower, comparable leaf mass and growth rates in sterilized soil. Invasive populations had higher growth rates with phosphorus addition but native ones did not. Soil sterilization decreased specific leaf area in both native and exotic populations. Negative effects of soil sterilization suggest that soil pathogens may not be as important as soil mutualists for T. sebifera performance. Moreover, interactive effects of sterilization and origin suggest that invasive T. sebifera may have evolved more beneficial relationships with the soil biota. Overall, seedlings from the invasive range outperformed those from the native range, however, an absence of soil biota or low phosphorus removed this advantage.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1932-6203;;WOS:000324238400092;24023930

Because tolerance and defence against herbivory differ with the ontogeny of a plant, the effects of herbivore damage on plant fitness vary with ontogenetic stage and are compounded throughout a plants lifetime. Environmental stresses such as light and nutrient limitations can further influence the response of the plant. Much is known about the response of plants in the seedling and reproductive adult stages, but less attention has been given to the pre-reproductive juvenile stage.Methods Juvenile plants of the North American invasive Lonicera maackii were exposed to simulated herbivory under high and low light and nitrogen availability and growth, allocation patterns and foliar defensive chemistry were measured. In a second experiment, complete nutrient availability and damage type (generalist caterpillar or simulated) were manipulated.Key Results Juvenile plants receiving 50 defoliation had lower total biomass and a higher root boolean AND:boolean AND shoot ratio than controls for all treatment combinations except low nitrogen/low light. Low light and defoliation increased root boolean AND:boolean AND shoot ratio. Light, fertilization and defoliation had little impact on foliar defensive chemistry. In the second experiment, there was a reduction in total biomass when caterpillar damage was applied. The root boolean AND:boolean AND shoot ratio increased under low soil fertility and was not affected by defoliation. Stem-diameter growth rates and specific leaf area did not vary by damage type or fertilization. Foliar protein increased through time, and more strongly in defoliated plants than in controls, while peroxidase activity and total flavonoids decreased with time. Overall, resource limitations were more influential than damage in the growth of juvenile L. maackii plants.Conclusions The findings illustrate that even when resources are limited, the tolerance and defence against herbivory of a woody invasive plant in the juvenile stage may contribute to the establishment and persistence of some species in a variety of habitats.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0305-7364;;WOS:000322952500011;23589632

We evaluated seedling morphological characteristics and seasonal growth of three indigenous tree species (Castanopsis chinensis, Michelia chapensis, and Psychotria rubra) that were transplanted into four plantations (eucalyptus, mixed-native, mixed-legume, mixed-conifer) in South China; in each plantation, two treatments (understory vegetation and litter retained or removed) were applied before the seedlings were transplanted. Seedling leaf morphological characteristics and biomass allocation were determined at the end of the experiment, and seedling relative growth rate as indicated by change in height (RGRh) was determined during the experiment. Whether understory vegetation and litter were removed or retained, RGRh tended to be higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Leaf morphological characteristics and biomass allocation were significantly affected by species identity. The effect of the understory vegetation and litter treatments on seedling morphological characteristics such as specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and root weight to total biomass ratio depended on species identity. Redundancy analysis showed that the three transplanted indigenous species differed in their responses to light conditions according to their tolerance to shade, and also differed in their responses to soil physical and chemical properties. Based on seedling seasonal growth patterns and morphological responses, we suggest that forest managers attempting to introduce seedlings of indigenous tree species should artificially supply water to increase seedling growth in the dry season. Also, the introduced tree species should be selected depending on the nature of the plantation; for example, C. chinensis and M. chapensis seedlings can be transplanted into mixed-legume plantations. Additionally, fertilizer with potassium and nitrogen should be used to improve seedling performance.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1860-1871;;WOS:000320233100001;

Since the increase of demand for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) may be in different proportions, the optimal N-P-K ratios at elevated [CO2] are likely different from those at the ambient [CO2]. This study investigated the effects of various N supply levels with constant and variable (constant P and K concentrations) N-P-K ratios under ambient and elevated [CO2] on black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. BSP) seedlings. One-year-old seedlings were exposed to two [CO2] (370 vs. 720 mu mol mol(-1)), two nutrient ratio regimes (constant vs. variable N/P/K ratios) and six N concentrations (10, 80, 150, 220, 290 and 360 mu mol mol(-1)) in four environmentally controlled greenhouses for 3.5 months. Growth response to N varied with [CO2] and N/P/K ratios: under the elevated [CO2], height growth increased with increasing N supply when P and K concentrations were kept constant across different N levels, but it only increased when increasing N from 10 to 150 mu mol mol(-1), and started to decline with further increase in N supply when N/P/K ratios were kept constant at different N levels; at the ambient [CO2], height growth was greatest at 150 mu mol mol(-1) N and was generally greater at 220-360 than at 10 and 80 mu mol mol(-1) N in both nutrient ratio treatments. The foliage to root ratio, shoot mass ratio and total biomass generally increased with increasing N supply but root mass ratio decreased. The smallest specific leaf area occurred at the lowest N supply when N/P/K ratios were kept constant but at 220 mu mol mol(-1) N when P and K concentrations were kept constant across different N supplies. The results of leaf nutrient concentrations suggest that the elevated [CO2] increased demand for N, P and K and the increase for N was greater than P and K, altering the relationship between growth and nitrogen supply. Under the elevated [CO2], high N supplies resulted in growth suppression by critical toxicity content only in the constant N/P/K ratios treatment but low N supplies led to growth suppression by critical deficiency content in both nutrient ratio treatments. At the ambient [CO2], in contrast, N/P/K ratio treatments did not affect growth suppression by critical deficiency or critical toxicity content. Because elevated CO2 causes unequal increases in N, P and K demands, N-P-K ratios should be considered when modeling plant growth responses to elevated CO2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Geographic patterns of leaf traits are shaped by phylogenetic, biological and environmental factors simultaneously. However, till now few studies have examined how these factors influenced leaf traits together, and how their effects differed at the within- and among-site levels.MethodsWe sampled leaf traits from a 1100 km shrub-biome transect across central Inner-Mongolia, including leaf mass per area (LMA), mass-based photosynthetic rate, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. We examined the effects of phylogenetic, biological (height and growth rate) and environmental (climate and soil) factors on leaf traits with mixed-model analyses of variance. Variation partitioning method was used to separate the joint and independent effects of these three types of factors.Important Findings(i) Climate and soil fertility (total or available nutrient concentrations) together explained 11.4-41.4% of among-site variations, with remarkable difference among traits. (ii) Height and height growth rate together explained 0.4-31.9% of trait variations (mostly among-site variations). Our results could only weakly support the ability of leaf traits as predictors for whole-plant growth. (iii) LMA was negatively related to height, which was consistent with the resource-use strategy hypothesis but inconsistent with the hypotheses proposed for coexisting trees, suggesting that the LMA height relationship is shaped by rather different mechanisms between the within- and among-communities levels. (iv) The variation partitioning analysis showed that, the relationships between leaf traits and biological characters largely reflected the differences in both leaf traits and biological characters among species that occupying different sites, The relative importance of phylogenetic, biological and environmental factors differed remarkably among leaf traits, between the within- and among-communities levels, and between different biomes.

The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (A (max), V (cmax), J (max)) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (K (L)) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (K (R)) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.";;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0912-3814;;WOS:000318569100016;

At the interspecific level, leaf economic traits associated with rapid resource capture are correlated with fast growth rates. However, relationships between leaf traits and growth are poorly understood at the intraspecific level. We examined two hypotheses: (i) leaf traits vary genotypically among Populus fremontii populations from different thermal environments; and (ii) leaf traits are related to growth rate of these P.fremontii populations. We used a common garden at the warm edge of P.fremontii distribution that included individuals transplanted from 11 provenances. Provenances varied in mean annual maximum temperature by 5 center dot 9 degrees C, reflecting a range of expected increases in temperature over the next 80years. Conservative leaf traits (e.g. low specific leaf area, N content, stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate and high leaf water-use efficiency) were positively related to growth rates of genotypes and populations, a pattern opposite of that widely reported among species in other studies. Provenance temperature explained 75% of the variation in multivariate leaf traits with the warmest provenances having the most conservative traits and highest growth rates. Clinal genetic variation suggests that P.fremontii may be adapted to thermal environments. Leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio was positively associated with growth rate, while leaf area-based net photosynthetic rate was negatively associated with growth rate; these results suggest that hydraulic architecture was more important than leaf-level photosynthetic rate in determining growth rate. Synthesis. Our results suggest that conservative leaf traits promote rapid growth of P.fremontii genotypes in extremely hot environments. Thus, relationships between leaf economic traits among species do not necessarily apply to the range of variation among genotypes within species. The generality of this pattern should be examined for other species that will be exposed to climate warming. Moreover, our research shows that common garden provenance trials are useful for identifying genotypes best suited to a predicted warmer climate and for improving understanding of the physiological basis for adaptation to warm environments.";;;;;;;;;7;0;7;0;7;0269-8463;;WOS:000317306000015;

In this study we attempt to identify mechanisms by which seedlings of dry tropical trees cope with water stress by adjusting their leaf characteristics to water availability and micro environments, and address following questions: How are leaf traits and relative growth rate (RGR) of the dominant seedling species of TDF affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture content (SMC)? What is the relationship of functional traits with each other? Can leaf traits singly or in combination predict the growth rate of seedling species of TDF? The study was conducted in situ on four sites (viz., Hathinala, Gaighat, Harnakachar and Ranitali, listed in order of decreasing SMC) within the tropical dry deciduous forest in northern India.Five leaf traits viz., specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), concentrations of leaf nitrogen (leaf N), phosphorus (leaf P) and chlorophyll (Chl) and two physiological processes, viz., stomatal conductance (Gs(net)) and photosynthetic rate (A(net)), and RGR, of four dominant tree seedling species of a TDF (viz., Buchanania lanzan, Diospyros melanoxylon, Shorea robusta and Terminalia tomentosa) on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed to predict RGR from mean values of SMC, leaf traits and physiological processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to observe the extent of intra- vs. inter-specific variability in the leaf traits and physiological rates.All the traits and physiological rates were interrelated and showed significant positive relationship with RGR except for the correlation of LDMC with RGR which was not significant. Further, relationships of SMC with all leaf traits, physiological rates and RGR were significant, except for that between SMC and SLA for B. lanzan and D. melanoxylon. The slope of seedling trait:SMC relationship, a measure of phenotypic plasticity in response to soil moisture gradient, varied among species. Among the four species, T. tomentosa was the most plastic and S. robusta the least.In conclusion, leaf traits and physiological processes were strongly related to soil water availability on the one hand and seedling growth on the other. Gs(net) is the most important variable which accounted for the greatest amount of variability (62%) in RGR, emphasizing the role of stomatal conductance in shaping growth patterns across spatial and temporal gradients of soil water availability. Gs(net) and SMC together explained 64% variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied by us are also important in modulating the growth of tropical tree seedlings.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1752-9921;;WOS:000316964200006;

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of foliar application of Si on chestnut leaf growth, photosynthesis and water relations in the presence of short, but intense water deficit.Sili-KA (R) solution (containing 0.12 % Si and 0.15 % K) was repeatedly (x 3) sprayed onto leaves of potted chestnut plantlets and irrigation was suspended 7 weeks later, for 8 days. Leaf growth, anatomy, as well as physiological and biochemical traits of the plantlets were studied.Si application enhanced chestnut growth, due to increased photosynthetic traits, including higher chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a to b ratio, photochemical efficiency of PSII, gas exchange (stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, net CO2 assimilation) and oxygen evolution rate. Meanwhile, Si yielded larger and thinner leaves, higher xylem, specific leaf area and transpiration rate, thus being beneficial to the tree in absorbing sunlight energy for photosynthesis and in alleviating heat stress. However, Si also lowered leaf sap osmotic pressure, causing the plant to lose water more quickly, thus being more susceptible to water stress.Si improved chestnut photosynthesis, growth, and heat stress tolerance, but it also increased the susceptibility to drought.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0032-079X;;WOS:000316391400015;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that tree species sorting on temperature gradients involves a trade-off between growth rate and cold resistance. Little is known about how these two major trade-offs interact.Methods Seedlings of Australian tropical and cool-temperate rainforest trees were grown in glasshouse environments to compare growth versus shade-tolerance trade-offs in these two assemblages. Biomass distribution, photosynthetic capacity and vessel diameters were measured in order to examine the functional correlates of species differences in light requirements and growth rate. Species light requirements were assessed by field estimation of the light compensation point for stem growth.Results Light-demanding and shade-tolerant tropical species differed markedly in relative growth rates (RGR), but this trend was less evident among temperate species. This pattern was paralleled by biomass distribution data: specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) of tropical species were significantly positively correlated with compensation points, but not those of cool-temperate species. The relatively slow growth and small SLA and LAR of Tasmanian light-demanders were associated with narrow vessels and low potential sapwood conductivity.Conclusions The conservative xylem traits, small LAR and modest RGR of Tasmanian light-demanders are consistent with selection for resistance to freeze-thaw embolism, at the expense of growth rate. Whereas competition for light favours rapid growth in light-demanding trees native to environments with warm, frost-free growing seasons, frost resistance may be an equally important determinant of the fitness of light-demanders in cool-temperate rainforest, as seedlings establishing in large openings are exposed to sub-zero temperatures that can occur throughout most of the year.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0305-7364;;WOS:000316691800015;23264237

Saplings of six dominant canopy species differing in shade tolerance were grown in five control and five N + P fertilized gaps. Hydraulic architectural traits such as wood density, the leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA : SA), vulnerability to cavitation (P50) and specific and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity were measured, as well as the relative growth rate, specific leaf area (SLA) and percentage of leaf damage by insect herbivores. Plant growth rates and resistance to drought-induced embolisms increased when nutrient limitations were removed. On average, the P50 of control plants was -1.1 MPa, while the P50 of fertilized plants was -1.6 MPa. Wood density and LA : SA decreased with N + P additions. A trade-off between vulnerability to cavitation and efficiency of water transport was not observed. The relative growth rate was positively related to the total leaf surface area per plant and negatively related to LA : SA, while P50 was positively related to SLA across species and treatments. Plants with higher growth rates and higher total leaf area in fertilized plots were able to avoid hydraulic dysfunction by becoming less vulnerable to cavitation (more negative P50). Two high-light-requiring species exhibited relatively low growth rates due to heavy herbivore damage. Contrary to expectations, shade-tolerant plants with relatively high resistance to hydraulic dysfunction and reduced herbivory damage were able to grow faster. These results suggest that during the initial phase of sapling establishment in gaps, species that were less vulnerable to cavitation and exhibited reduced herbivory damage had faster realized growth rates than less shade-tolerant species with higher potential growth rates. Finally, functional relationships between hydraulic traits and growth rate across species and treatments were maintained regardless of soil nutrient status.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0829-318X;;WOS:000316751900007;23436182

Morphological, physiological and biochemical measures were taken. Exposure to UVA+UVB increased the overall leaf mass per area (LMA) and the leaf carotenoids/chlorophyll a?+?b ratio of plants in relation to plants grown without UV or with UVA, respectively. In contrast, we did not find a general effect of UV on the leaf content of phenols or UVB-absorbing compounds of the studied species. Regarding plant growth, UV inhibited the above-ground biomass production of well-watered plants of Pistacia lentiscus. Conversely, under low irrigation, UVA tended to abolish the reduction in growth experienced by P. lentiscus plants growing in a UV-free environment, in accordance with UVA-enhanced apparent electron transport rate (ETR) values under drought in this species. UVA also induced an overall increase in root biomass when plants of the studied species were grown under a low water supply. In conclusion, while plant exposition to UVA favored root growth under water shortage, UVB addition only gave rise to photoprotective responses, such as the increase in LMA or in the leaf carotenoids/chlorophyll a?+?b ratio of plants. Species-specific responses to UV were not related with the xerophytic or mesophytic character of the studied species.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0031-9317;;WOS:000313896000011;22671961

In this study we evaluated the effects of higher temperatures with and without water addition on the survival and growth of recently emerged (small) and large seedlings of the widely distributed species Nothofagus pumilio in subalpine forests of the southern Chilean Andes. We also examined the variations in seedling traits related to carbon balance in order to infer the causal mechanisms of survival and growth responses. Treatments of open top chambers (OTCs) were combined with watering in two locations with differing climates: Antillanca (40 degrees S, humid) and Cerro Castillo (46 degrees S, drier). OTCs increased mean and maximum air temperatures by 0.6 degrees C and 2-3 degrees C, respectively, and decreased soil humidity by 56% in Antillanca and 30% in Cerro Castillo, fulfilling methodological expectations and climate model predictions. After two complete growing seasons, the survival, relative growth rate (RGR), biomass, and a suite of seedling traits were measured and analyzed using mixed-effects models. Warming and warming in combination with watering significantly increased large seedling survival in Cerro Castillo. In Antillanca, warmer conditions increased the height, biomass, and leaf area of small seedlings, and the RGR of large seedlings. In this location, warming also caused lower leaf carbon isotopic composition in both age classes and higher specific leaf area in small seedlings, suggesting whole-plant carbon gain improvements; warming did not produce any drought effects. Our results indicate that warming produces positive effects on the seedling establishment of N. pumilio in the southern Andes, highlighting the importance of site-specific effects in response to climate change in widespread species. Site-specific effects can most likely explain the discrepancies between the results of this study and the predictions outlined by previous studies for these forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Taxanes are one of the most effective anticancer drugs. This study was undertaken to describe the levels and patterns of taxane variation in the Sudetian region (SW Poland). Paclitaxel (T) and 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) concentrations were analysed in five populations. Needles and twigs were analysed from 60 individuals (30 males and 30 females) in each population. In addition, morphometric measurements were taken in the populations to obtain light intensity coefficients (specific leaf area, SLA). High variability in the taxane contents at both intra and interpopulational levels was found. Nevertheless, females had a significantly higher taxane content compared to males. Because taxanes are carbon-based secondary metabolites, females have higher rate of gas exchange of females compared to males. This was probably an adaptation to greater reproductive effort incurred by females. In this regard, female individuals seem to be better for selecting elite cultivars with a higher taxane production. The relationship between light intensity and taxane content was not significant. Shading, important for optimizing crop production, should not reduce the concentration of taxanes.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0137-5881;;WOS:000313015300015;

Location Arid scrubland, Atacama desert, north-central Chile. Methods One-week-old seedlings of six coastal desert shrub species (Centaurea chilensis, Encelia canescens, Flourensia thurifera, Pleocarphus revolutus, Senna cumingii and Haplopappus parvifolius) were planted in the field under six treatment combinations: three light environments (low, intermediate and high radiation) and two water levels (natural rainfall (55.4mm) and natural rainfall plus 100mm irrigation). We quantified seedling survival for each species during 22weeks, estimated relative growth rate, and examined how light and water affect whole-plant responses, particularly specific leaf area, leaf mass ratio and rootshoot ratio. Results We found species-specific differences in the temporal pattern of mortality. Water and/or light levels affected seedling survival of all species, excluding C. chilensis. Relative growth rate (RGR) increased in low-light conditions in C. chilensis and P. revolutus, but otherwise did not vary in response to differences in either light or water, independently or to their interaction. Across species, the effect of water on specific leaf area (SLA) was inconsistent, increasing both in drought conditions (C. chilensis) and in treatments with supplemental water (S. cumingii). Additionally, SLA tended to increase with decreasing light levels for most species (F. thurifera, H. parvifolius, C. chilensis). In our study, only F. thrurifera and C. chilensis showed changes in leaf mass ratio (LMR) and only with respect to light levels; specifically, LMR tended to increase with decreasing light level. Biomass allocation was independent of light and water for all species except F. thurifera, which showed an increase in root biomass in drought conditions. Conclusions Overall, we did not find evidence to support a trade-off between drought and shade tolerance during early plant establishment. Our results suggest that water is the most important resource that limits recruitment in the coastal desert. Therefore, increased aridity in this system is likely to severely hinder seedling recruitment of the native coastal desert shrubs.";;;;;;;;;2;1;2;0;3;1100-9233;;WOS:000310798600006;

Genome size was therefore used as a proxy for them in order to assess how common plant traits such as height, specific leaf area and seed size/number predict species regional abundance. In this study it is hypothesized that if there is residual correlation between genome size and abundance after these traits are partialled out, there must be additional ecological effects of cell size and/or cell-division rate.Methods Variation in genome size, plant traits and regional abundance were examined in 436 herbaceous species of central European flora, and relationships were sought for among these variables by correlation and path analysis.Key Results Species regional abundance was weakly but significantly correlated with genome size; the relationship was stronger for annuals (R-2 = 0145) than for perennials (R-2 = 0027). In annuals, genome size was linked to abundance via its effect on seed size, which constrains seed number and hence population growth rate. In perennials, it weakly affected (via height and specific leaf area) competitive ability. These relationships did not change qualitatively after phylogenetic correction. In both annuals and perennials there was an unresolved effect of genome size on abundance.Conclusions The findings indicate that additional predictors of regional abundance should be sought among variables that are linked to cell size and cell-division rate. Signals of these cell-level processes remain identifiable even at the landscape scale, and show deep differences between perennials and annuals. Plant population biology could thus possibly benefit from more systematic use of indicators of cell-level processes.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0305-7364;;WOS:000310892900002;22628380

In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. Height GR plasticity accounted for 49% of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0022-0477;;WOS:000310336500016;

We studied several growth and functional traits of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. xP. tremuloides Michx.) in response to elevated atmospheric humidity (on average 7% over the ambient level) in a free air experimental facility during three growing seasons (2008-2010) in Estonia, which represents northern temperate climate (boreo-nemoral zone). Data were collected from three humidified (H) and three control (C) plots, and analysed using nested linear models. Elevated air humidity significantly reduced height, stem diameter and stem volume increments and transpiration of the trees whereas these effects remained highly significant also after considering the side effects from soil-related confounders within the 2.7 ha study area. Tree leaves were smaller, lighter and had lower leaf mass per area (LMA) in H plots. The magnitude and significance of the humidity treatment effect - inhibition of above-ground growth rate - was more pronounced in larger trees. The lower growth rate in the humidified plots can be partly explained by a decrease in transpiration-driven mass flow of NO3- in soil, resulting in a significant reduction in the measured uptake of N to foliage in the H plots. The results suggest that the potential growth improvement of fast-growing trees like aspens, due to increasing temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, might be smaller than expected at high latitudes if a rise in atmospheric humidity simultaneously takes place.;;;;;;;;;9;0;7;0;9;1932-6203;;WOS:000307810000055;22880067

Many studies have demonstrated that natural enemies maintain local diversity via negative density dependence, but we know little about how natural enemies influence beta-diversity across habitats and/or regions. One way herbivores could influence plant beta-diversity is by driving allocation trade-offs that promote habitat specialization across resource gradients. We therefore predicted that increasing resource availability should be accompanied by increasing herbivory rates and decreasing plant allocation to defense. Second, relative abundances within plant lineages are predicted to reflect patterns of habitat specialization and allocation trade-offs. A phylogenetic context is vital not only to compare homologous plant traits (including defense strategies) across habitat types, but also to connect evolutionary trade-offs to patterns of species diversification in each phylogenetic lineage.We tested these predictions for trees in white-sand, clay terra firme, and seasonally flooded forests in Peru and French Guiana that represent the range of soil fertility, forest structure, and floristic compositions found throughout the Amazon region. We established 74 0.5-ha plots in these habitats and sampled all trees. Within 12 representative plots we marked newly expanding leaves of 394 saplings representing 68 species, including the most abundant species in each plot in addition to species from five focal lineages: Swartzia and Inga (Fabaceae), Protieae (Burseracaeae), Bombacoideae (Malvaceae), and Micropholis (Sapotaceae). We measured total leaf production rates for each sapling and calculated relative herbivory impact as the ratio between herbivory rate and leaf production rate.Herbivory rates averaged 2.1% per month, did not correlate with leaf production rate, and were similar across habitats. Relative herbivore impacts exceeded leaf production rates for most species. Leaf production rate averaged 2.8%, was significantly higher in seasonally flooded forests than the other two habitats, and exhibited significant correlations with specific leaf area. Species with high herbivory rates exhibited significantly lower relative abundances in terra firme forests. Overall, focal species within lineages present contrasting patterns regarding their herbivory rates and leaf production rate within habitats. These results highlight why a lineage-based approach is necessary when attempting to connect hypotheses regarding evolutionary trade-offs to community assembly patterns.;;;;;;;;;11;0;11;0;11;d_c-58;;WOS:000307302400016;

It has been suggested that changes in these traits in response to light availability can increase herbivore susceptibility. We tested the adaptive value of plant functional traits linked with carbon gain in contrasting light environments and also evaluated whether herbivores can modify selection on these traits in each light environment. In a temperate rainforest, we examined phenotypic selection on functional traits in seedlings of the pioneer tree Aristotelia chilensis growing in sun (canopy gap) and shade (forest understory) and subjected to either natural herbivory or herbivore exclusion. We found differential selection on functional traits depending on light environment. In sun, there was positive directional selection on photosynthetic rate and relative growth rate (RGR), indicating that selection favors competitive ability in a high-resource environment. Seedlings with high specific leaf area (SLA) and intermediate RGR were selected in shade, suggesting that light capture and conservative resource use are favored in the understory. Herbivores reduced the strength of positive directional selection acting on SLA in shade. We provide the first demonstration that natural herbivory rates can change the strength of selection on plant ecophysiological traits, that is, attributes whose main function is resource uptake. Research addressing the evolution of shade tolerance should incorporate the selective role of herbivores.;;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;5;0003-0147;;WOS:000306110300001;22766937

We used the regression approach and ecovalence analysis to examine populations' performance stability. Most populations had average responsiveness to environment, and a set of least-responsive poor-growing populations contributed the most to the G x E interaction. Variation in bud burst phenology was associated with geographical distribution of tested progenies. The early bud-bursting populations originated from the north-eastern to north-central Poland, and a group of late bud-bursting populations originated mainly from the south-eastern region. Correlations between bud burst and growth traits were weak to medium and varied by site, but early bud-bursting populations tended to show stronger growth on height and diameter. We found significant differences among populations in final leader length, shoot elongation time and relative growth rate (RGR). However, RGR and shoot elongation time explained less than 30% of variation in leader length and were weakly correlated with tree height. Populations varied in needle length, specific leaf area and foliar nitrogen concentration, but time trends in these traits did not vary among populations or predefined groups of populations. Therefore, the analysis of growth rhythm or needle traits did not help resolve variation in tree growth to support selection decisions. Contrary to our expectation, progeny of seed orchards did not perform significantly better than that of commercial seed stands. This finding, however, should not be extrapolated beyond our set of populations. Nonetheless, the local seed sources were not always the best. From a selection standpoint, our results help culling the worst populations rather than selecting the best ones. Therefore, testing individual family progeny and genetic roguing of existing seed orchards is highly recommended.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1612-4669;;WOS:000304102400027;

Leaves sampled from the open plot had significantly higher rates of light-saturated gross photosynthesis and dark respiration, and a significantly lower specific leaf area than leaves from the other plots. The relative growth rate of whole plant biomass was significantly higher in plots that received larger amounts of light. The variations in these properties under the various light conditions are considered to reflect the ability of hiba seedlings to adapt to available light. In the late autumn, leaves sampled from the open and from the gap under deciduous trees indicated photoinhibition. However, the estimated value of monthly net photosynthesis of hiba seedlings was greater in these plots, indicating that the benefit of a greater light intensity for photosynthesis seems to be larger than the detriment of photoinhibition. The seasonal pattern of photosynthesis by understory hiba seedlings was affected by the phenology of canopy trees. Light availability under the canopy of deciduous trees associated with phenological gaps helped hiba seedlings to tolerate the relatively dark conditions during the subsequent foliation period. These results for reaction to the light regime and for the phenology of hiba seedlings are practicable for hiba forest management.;;;;;;;;;1;1;1;0;2;1341-6979;;WOS:000303146700005;

Nutrients are a critical resource for plant growth, but the elements limiting growth in tropical forests have rarely been determined.2. We investigated the influence of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium(K) and micronutrients on seedling biomass and nutrient allocation in a factorial nutrient fertilization experiment in lowland tropical forest at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We also measured 8 years of herbivory and growth for 1800 seedlings. We sought to determine the identity of limiting elements and possible nutrient interactions.3. The five study species were Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis and Tetragastris panamensis. Plants grew in deeply shaded understorey with a mean canopy openness of 4.9%(+/-0.7%; 1 SE).4. Tissue N concentration increased by 11% with N addition. Tissue P concentration increased by 16% with P addition. Tissue K increased by 4% with K addition. K addition reduced root-to-shoot biomass ratio. There was no significant effect of fertilization on specific leaf area or leaf area ratio.5. The proportion of leaves damaged and the mean level of damage by herbivory increased with P and K addition and showed a significant P x K interaction.6. Across all species and years, relative growth rate of height increased with K addition and with N and P in combination. Relative growth rate of leaf count trended 8.5% higher with K addition (P = 0.076).7. We also added micronutrients in a parallel experiment. There was no effect of micronutrient addition on any seedling parameter.8. Synthesis. K addition affected seedlings by enhancing tissue nutrient concentration, increasing herbivory, reducing root-to-shoot biomass ratio and increasing height growth. Additional effects of N or P on tissue chemistry, herbivory and growth offer support for the multiple limiting resources hypothesis. Our results suggest that seedling growth is limited by nutrients, especially K, even under highly shaded conditions in this lowland tropical forest.";;;;;;;;;26;3;26;1;30;0022-0477;;WOS:000300500800002;

Secondary forest types were: Vismia (on land formerly clear-cut, used for pasture and intensively burned) and Cecropia (no pasture usage or intensive fires after clear-cut).Results: A principal components analysis indicated that most of the primary forest species exhibited a similar habit and were characterized by short shoots and small, round leaves with low specific leaf area, whereas secondary forest species had a broad range of trait values. At the plot level, primary and secondary forest communities were separated mainly by plant length and leaf size. Plant size varied more within secondary than within primary forest plots. The two secondary forest types could not be separated based on the traits of liana regeneration. Relative growth rate (RGR) did not correlate significantly with any measured plant trait, except for a negative relation to initial length.

I found that (i) the spatial heterogeneity across the transect was greater than the temporal heterogeneity at any given microsite on the transect for both light and water and there was a positive correlation between them, (ii) Couepia obovata Ducke, the largest seeded and the only subcanopy tree, survived the best and showed both the largest relative height growth rate (RHGR) and the largest specific leaf area (SLA), while among the two early successional trees, Tapirira guianensis J.B. Aublet had the largest leaf area ratio (LAR) and the largest leaf mass ratio (LMR) and Duguethia spixiana Mart. had the largest root to shoot ratio (RTOS), (iii) for T. guianensis, SLA increased with increasing light and soil water potential predicted both increasing LMR and decreasing RTOS with increasing soil water, and (iv) soil water potential could also predict increasing LAR with increasing water for D. spixiana and, for C. obovata, soil water potential predicted more survivorship, LMR, and RHGR but less RTOS, all with increasing soil water.

However, resource-use efficiency, rather than opportunistic resource capture, may confer more advantages when resources are scarce. In this study, performance and functional traits of invasive and non-invasive members of the genus Pinus were contrasted under the condition of nutrient limitations. Invasive species outperformed non-invasive congeners by growing 28% faster, on average. Invasives and non-invasives did not differ in biomass allocation traits (root-weight ratio, stem-weight ratio, leaf-weight ratio, leaf area ratio, root: shoot coefficient), but invaders had thinner and/or less dense leaves, as shown by a significantly lower leaf mass per area and leaf dry mass fraction. No differences between invasives and non-invasives were apparent in area-based leaf content of nitrogen, chlorophyll, or total protein, nor did the two groups differ in how efficiently they took up nutrients (specific absorption rate per unit root mass). The trait most strongly associated with invasives' superior performance was photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency. Non-invaders were more water-use efficient. The results suggests that the relative performance of invasive and non-invasive species is context-dependent. Invaders may allocate leaf nitrogen more efficiently to maximize photosynthesis and growth in nitrogen-poor soils, while non-invaders with more heavily defended leaves may have an advantage in drier areas. Rather than searching for a suite of traits that constitutes ""invasiveness"", it may be necessary to identify potential invaders by traits that are most adaptive to the local resource context.";;;;;;;;;9;0;9;0;9;1387-3547;;WOS:000298645800031;

We investigated the effects of water availability (rainfed versus irrigated) and pruning-induced differences in plant stature on growth, biomass partitioning, and canopy size at a plantation site in Madagascar in 2010. Plants of different pruning types differed in trunk height (43 versus 29 cm) and primary branches total length (171 versus 310 cm). The two pruning types had effects on dry mass formation and leaf area projection (LAP) during the vegetation period. Trees which had a shorter trunk and longer lateral branches produced more biomass and had a higher LAP. Total dry mass formation varied from 489 to 912 g m(-2) and LAP from 3.26 to 7.37. Total aboveground biomass increased from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 4.89 +/- 1.4 kg tree(-1) and from 4.6 +/- 1.8 to 8.9 +/- 1.0 kg tree(-1) for the pruning types with shorter and longer lateral branches, respectively. Growth of twigs and leaves was positively correlated with total length of branches. Relative dry mass allocation to branches, twigs and leaves, length of twigs per cm of branches and specific leaf area (13.57 +/- 0.72 m(2) kg(-1)) were not affected by pruning and water supply. Trees with shorter branches had higher LAD. Results indicate that pruning type should be considered as a management tool to optimize biomass production. Detailed studies on effects of canopy size and shape on radiation interception and growth are required to improve the productivity of jatropha.

Invasiveness is generally linked to higher values of reproductive, physiological and growth-related traits of the invasives relative to the natives in the introduced range. Phenotypic plasticity of these traits has also been cited to increase the success of invasive species but has been little studied in invasive tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, we compared ecophysiological traits between an invasive species to Europe, Acer negundo, and early- and late-successional co-occurring native species, under different light, nutrient availability and disturbance regimes. We also compared species of the same species groups in situ, in riparian forests.Results: Under non-limiting resources, A. negundo seedlings showed higher growth rates than the native species. However, A. negundo displayed equivalent or lower photosynthetic capacities and nitrogen content per unit leaf area compared to the native species; these findings were observed both on the seedlings in the greenhouse experiment and on adult trees in situ. These physiological traits were mostly conservative along the different light, nutrient and disturbance environments. Overall, under non-limiting light and nutrient conditions, specific leaf area and total leaf area of A. negundo were substantially larger. The invasive species presented a higher plasticity in allocation to foliage and therefore in growth with increasing nutrient and light availability relative to the native species.Conclusions: The higher level of plasticity of the invasive species in foliage allocation in response to light and nutrient availability induced a better growth in non-limiting resource environments. These results give us more elements on the invasiveness of A. negundo and suggest that such behaviour could explain the ability of A. negundo to outperform native tree species, contributes to its spread in European resource-rich riparian forests and impedes its establishment under closed-canopy hardwood forests.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;1472-6785;;BCI:BCI201200313774;22115342

Understanding ecological strategies of invasive species relative to the entire native community is important in understanding and managing both the mechanisms and the potential impacts of invasion, but few studies have taken this approach.2. We utilize advances in plant ecology to compare functional traits of an invasive shrub species, autumn-olive Elaeagnus umbellata, to those of the understorey native woody plant community in a southeast Michigan forest. We estimate species trait distributions for six leaf functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf laminar area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio and delta N-15) using a kernel estimator. We then use pairwise trait distance and overlaps to describe the ecological strategy of the invasive shrub relative to that of the native understorey woody plant community.3. The overlap of the invasive shrub's trait distribution with those of the native species was found to be smaller than the overlap of a native shrub's distribution with other native species, consistent with the empty niche hypothesis of invasion. However, the invasive species' mean leaf functional trait values typically fall outside of the range of most native species' mean trait values, suggesting the invasive shrub extends trait space for understorey individuals of the native woody plant community.4. The invasive shrub's leaf trait values are characteristic of a sun-demanding species, contradicting its presence in the shaded forest understorey community and its persistence in an empty niche. We propose that this novel use of leaf functional traits by the invasive shrub could indicate that the invasion is facilitated by additional mechanisms such as release from natural enemies, association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, use of an empty temporal niche (namely the light available to the understorey early in the growing season), bird dispersal or some synthesis of these factors.5. Synthesis and applications. This study develops plant functional trait theory by studying an invasive species within the context of the entire native woody plant community. The approach can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms of an invasion event and suggest ecological consequences and related management strategies for the maintenance of native forest communities. Specifically, this study, along with known data on the invasive species, suggests aggressive management in sunny gap and edge habitat provides the best strategy for long-term control.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;0021-8901;;WOS:000295095100005;

What is the relationship of functional attributes with each other? Can leaf attributes singly or in combination predict the growth rate of tree species of TDF?Location: Sonebhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, India.Methods: Eight leaf attributes, specific leaf area (SLA); leaf carbon concentration (LCC); leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC); leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC); chlorophyll concentration (Chl), mass-based stomatal conductance (Gs(mass)); mass based photosynthetic rate (A(mass)); intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi); and relative growth rate (RGR), of six dominant tree species of a dry tropical forest on four sites were analysed for species, site and season effects over a 2-year period. Step-wise multiple regression was performed for predicting RGR from mean values of SMC and leaf attributes. Path analysis was used to determine which leaf attributes influence RGR directly and which indirectly.Results: Species differed significantly in terms of all leaf attributes and RGR. The response of species varied across sites and seasons. The attributes were positively interrelated, except for WUEi, which was negatively related to all other attributes. The positive correlation was strongest between Gs(mass) and A(mass) and the negative correlation was strongest between Gs(mass) and WUEi. Differences in RGR due to site were not significant when soil moisture was controlled, but differences due to season remained significant. The attributes showed plasticity across moisture gradients, which differed among attributes and species. Gs(mass) was the most plastic attribute. Among the six species, Terminalia tomentosa exhibited the greatest plasticity in six functional attributes. In the step-wise multiple regression, A(mass), SLA and Chl among leaf attributes and SMC among environmental factors influenced the RGR of tree species. Path analysis indicated the importance of SLA, LNC, Chl and A(mass) in determining RGR.Conclusion: A(mass), SMC, SLA and Chl in combination can be used to predict RGR but could explain only three-quarters of the variability in RGR, indicating that other traits/factors, not studied here, are also important in modulating growth of tropical trees. RGR of tree species in the dry tropical environment is determined by soil moisture, whereas the response of mature trees of different species is modulated by alterations in key functional attributes such as SLA, LNC and Chl.";;;;;;;;;8;0;7;0;8;1100-9233;;WOS:000294561200015;

These data were used to test whether genome size was significantly different for invasive (n = 21; species known to be established and spreading in foreign environments) and non-invasive (n = 71; species that have been introduced to foreign environments but which are not known to be spreading) species. Data for five functional traits [seed mass, specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum height and dispersal mode] and three characteristics of native range (size, temperature range and precipitation range) were used to test for univariate and multivariate relationships between (1) invasiveness and traits and (2) genome size and traits.Results Genome size ranged from 1.20 to 2.13 pg/2C and was not significantly smaller in invasive compared with non-invasive acacias. However, invasive acacias were found to be taller and possess a larger native range size and a wider range of annual precipitation when compared with non-invasive acacias. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between invasive and non-invasive acacias (PERMANOVA; P < 0.01) driven largely by differences in native range characteristics. We detected a positive relationship between genome size and SLA (P = 0.02) and elaiosome dispersal mode (P < 0.01) in analyses across species, but these findings were not supported by evolutionary divergence analyses.Main conclusions Genome size variation does not underpin variation in traits associated with the invasive/non-invasive dichotomy in introduced acacias, probably because of the very small DNA values in the Acacia species studied.

We examined adaptive associations between seedling traits and habitat specialization. Two habitat contrasts were investigated across several evolutionary lineages of angiosperms: species specialized to forest vs. open habitats and to dry vs. wet habitats. We also tested whether effects of shade and drought vary independently or, alternatively, if shade may amplify effects on drought-stressed plants. Seedling response in terms of growth rate, height, slenderness, specific leaf area (SLA) and degree of elongation (longest internode; petiole or leaf-sheath depending on species' morphology) to light and watering treatments was assessed. We used a factorial design involving three light regimes and two watering frequencies. The open-shaded habitat contrast and the dry-wet habitat contrast were investigated using six and five pairs of congeneric species, respectively. The congeneric species pair design controlled for confounding effects of evolutionary history prior to divergence in habitat specialization. Seedling growth rate generally decreased with shade and reduced watering frequency. Plant height was generally largest at intermediate light. Specialization to shaded habitats was associated with a more conservative growth strategy, i.e. showing a more modest growth response to increasing light. Species from all habitats showed the highest relative elongation at intermediate light, except for the moist-habitat species, for which elongation increased with shade. Contrary to our expectations, species from dry habitats grew bigger than species from moist habitats in all treatments. SLA responded to the light treatment, but not to watering regime. The contrasting light and moisture conditions across habitats appear to not have selected for differences in SLA. We conclude that seedling phase strategies of resource allocation in temperate herbs contribute to their habitat specialization.

Planting Korean pine trees under the canopy of secondary forest is a feasible approach for recovering Korean pine and broadleaved mixed forest. For establishing an effective growth promotion method for under-canopy planted young Korean pine trees, two stands were selected as the experiment plots, Stand A (planted in 1989) and Stand B (planted in 1982), and an experiment of microenvironment regulation was conducted relying mainly on Opening degree (K=1, K=1.5, K=2, CK) in 2004. The results were shown that the adjustment had promoted growth of diameter and height of Korean pine planted in Stand A and Stand B, and had a significant influence on the growth rate of basal diameter, diameter at breast height and height in the two growth stands. The four years periodic increment of mean diameter and height of Korean pine planted in 1989 and in 1982 after regulation in K=1 level were 63.4% (D-0) and 82.7% (H), 64.8% (D-1.3) and 69.7% (H) higher than that of control respectively.

Quality indexes of natural pruning capacity, normal form quotient and crown size was not significantly changed but shown a positive tendency.

The ability to display functional responses to shading, i.e. phenotypic changes that enhance plant performance in low light, is fundamental for plant success in forest communities. Herbivory may constrain plant functional responses to shading and this could explain the often observed lower plant tolerance of herbivore damage in the shade.2. We carried out a field trial and a greenhouse experiment to evaluate whether simulated herbivory (i) causes greater fitness losses in the shade, and (ii) modifies plant functional responses to shading. Changes in functional traits were measured at the biochemical, leaf, shoot and whole-plant levels, in seedlings of the light-demanding evergreen tree Aristotelia chilensis (Elaeocarpaceae), which is endemic to South American austral forests.3. We hypothesized that plant responses to shade would be constrained by herbivory due to within-plant limitations in resource availability and/or antagonistic interactions between responses to shade and herbivory. We further expected that this limitation would result in a greater field mortality of damaged plants in forest understory as compared to open sites.4. Simulated herbivory (50% defoliation) on field seedlings decreased 8-month plant survival in the shade (forest understory) but not in the sun (canopy gaps) in a temperate rainforest. Likewise, simulated herbivory in the greenhouse decreased plant growth rate and final biomass in the shade treatment but not in the sun treatment.5. The phenotypic responses to shading of seven traits were constrained by simulated herbivory: chlorophyll, leaf shape, leaf blade angle, petiole angle, SLA (specific leaf area), internodes length and total leaf area. A path-analysis showed that most of these constrained responses were uncorrelated to each other. Some of these results might be explained by antagonistic interactions between molecules or pathways involved in plant responses to shading and herbivory. Four functional traits exhibited greater responses to shading in damaged plants: A(max) (Photosynthetic rate), foliar carbon, shoot : root ratio and LMR (leaf mass ratio); but most of them resulted from correlated changes in SLA.6. The present study undertook a mechanistic approach to the often observed pattern of greater impact of herbivore damage on plant performance in low light environments. The central finding of this study is that the unraveling of herbivory-constrained plant functional responses to shading may explain the often observed greater fitness losses due to herbivory in the shade. It is also suggested that herbivory pressure is an underestimated factor in pioneer species distribution along the light gradient.";;;;;;;;;7;1;7;1;8;0269-8463;;WOS:000290174500007;

In this work, we assessed the response of Holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) and mastic shrub (Pistacia lentiscus) seedlings to high concentrations of Cd and Tl in the rhizosphere. These are non-essential trace elements, with a potential high mobility in the soil-plant system. Seedlings of these species are frequently used in the afforestation of degraded soils in mining areas. Plants were exposed to different levels of Cd (20, 80 and 200 mg L(-1)) and Tl (2, 10 and 20 mg L(-1)) in a sand culture. Biomass allocation, growth rates, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange were studied. Both metals affected root biomass. Cadmium produced an increase in the root mass ratio and a decrease in the specific leaf area of the plants in oak seedlings, while Tl did not provoke such response. Mastic plants were more sensitive to Tl and Cd than oak plants. Between elements, Tl provoked more severe toxic effects in the plants, affecting the antennae complexes and reaction centers of the photosystem II. Both elements decreased net assimilation rates (down to a 20% of the control plants) and stomatal conductance (5-10% of the values for the control plants). Cadmium was highly retained in the roots of both species, while Tl was highly translocated into the leaves. In general, Holm oak showed a higher tolerance for Cd than for Tl, and a higher resistance to both metals than mastic shrub, due to a high capacity for Cd retention at the root level. However, such accumulation in roots may induce water stress in the seedling exposed to Cd. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;;;;;;;;;6;1;6;0;7;0045-6535;;WOS:000291120400016;21281955

Foliar phosphorus (P) concentration is the sum of the concentrations of P fractions in cells, such as inorganic P and various P-containing biochemical compounds (e.g. nucleic acids, lipids and sugar phosphates). Plants generally reduce foliar P concentration and enhance P-use efficiency in response to low soil P availability. However, how plants allocate P among foliar P fractions to reduce foliar P concentration remains unclear.2. We investigated foliar P fractions and leaf traits of 21 tropical tree species along a soil P availability gradient across three tropical montane rain forests on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. We chemically and sequentially fractionated foliar P into the following four fractions: structural P (i.e. phospholipids), metabolic P (collectively including Pi, ATP and sugar phosphates), nucleic acid P and residual P (phosphoproteins and unidentified residue).3. With decreasing soil P availability, foliar P concentration decreased and leaf mass per area (LMA) increased. The reduction in foliar P concentration strongly correlated with the reduction in the concentrations of both metabolic P and nucleic acid P. Although increased LMA implies an increased allocation to structural tissues, there was no trade-off in P allocation between metabolic P and structural P with increasing LMA. This suggests that tropical tree species on P-poor soils increase the toughness of leaves (i.e. prolonged leaf life span) and also maintain high photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) without increasing the cost of P for structural tissues.4. Phosphorus resorption efficiency increased with decreasing soil P availability. The amount of P resorbed before leaf abscission on P-poor soils exceeded that of metabolic P. This suggests that tropical tree species achieve the high P resorption efficiency by withdrawing immobile fractions (i.e. nucleic acid P and structural P) in addition to metabolic P.5. Synthesis. We conclude that tree species on P-poor soils reduce the demand for foliar P by reducing concentrations of both metabolic P and nucleic acid P, which may potentially limit growth and productivity. However, these tree species can maintain high whole-plant P-use efficiency, because such responses in foliar P fractions do not decrease PPUE, leaf life span and P resorption efficiency.;;;;;;;;;15;0;14;0;15;0022-0477;;WOS:000289626000021;

In the northern Rocky Mountains, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is considered an early-successional species, able to establish in exposed microsites, while late-successional species such as Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) are more dependent on neighboring vegetation to facilitate establishment. We compared ecophysiological traits associated with carbon balance of newly germinated seedlings of whitebark pine and Engelmann spruce along an herb cover gradient to (1) infer which ecophysiological properties explain the establishment success of seedlings, and (2) to assess differences in establishment patterns with respect to distance from neighboring vegetation. We measured survival over 2 years, and concurrently measured gas exchange and water relations (photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration), morphology [specific leaf area (SLA)], and biochemistry [chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) and nonstructural carbohydrates]. Both species initially established in the most exposed microsites away from vegetation during their first growing season, but only pine persisted in exposed microsites to the end of the second growing season. Pine exhibited phenotypic traits to increase stress tolerance (e.g., higher soluble sugar concentrations, lower SLA) and improve carbon balance (e.g., greater water use efficiency, lower respiration, higher F(v)/F(m)) compared to spruce in exposed sites, but had lower carbon balance under herb cover. Superior establishment success of pine in exposed microsites at treeline could thus be attributed to a suite of intrinsic physiological advantages that are apparent at the earliest stage of development.;;;;;;;;;6;0;4;0;6;1385-0237;;WOS:000287708900005;

The lack of genetic variability of stone pine (Pinus pinea L) could limit the adaptation potential of the species to more severe droughts. However, information on intra-specific variability in adaptive traits that might confer potential drought tolerance is scant for stone pine. In this study, we explored the adaptation potential of stone pine to water deficit through variability of key functional traits. In particular, inter-clonal variation in whole plant performance in response to water deficit was studied. The role of inter-clonal variation in functional traits and phenotypic plasticity as determinants of whole plant performance under water deficit were also assessed. Relative growth rate (RGR) and key morphological and physiological traits were studied in ramets of 20 different clones of stone pine from a wide range of populations in the Iberian Peninsula. The plants were grown in climatic chamber under controlled environmental conditions and were submitted to an experimental water deficit of 20 days. The results showed significant inter-clonal variation in total dry mass, RGR, biomass partitioning specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net photosynthetic rate (A(n)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE(i)). Significant phenotypic plasticity in response to drought was found for A(n), g(s) and WUE(i) but it did not differ among clones. The clones could be clustered into different groups according to the variability of the studied traits in a principal components analysis. LAR, SLA and net photosynthetic rates explained most of the variation. A combination of traits (high LAR and low WUE(i)) agreeing with a water spending strategy rather than with a water saving strategy seemed to underlie enhanced RGR under water deficit. Stone pine showed high phenotypic plasticity and significant intra-specific variation in functional traits in response to water deficit. The pattern of variation found in morphological and physiological traits might allow adaptation to short term water deficit in this species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We examined to what extent leaf life span is related to inter- and intraspecific variation in seedling relative growth rate (RGR). We examined relationships between relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) and leaf life span, together with classical RGR(M) components [net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and leaf area ratio (LAR)] for seedlings of five hardwood species of different successional position across a wide range of environmental resource availability, including the presence or absence of leaf litter in shaded forest understory, small canopy gaps, and large canopy gaps. Both SLA and LAR were negatively correlated with RGR(M) along the environmental gradient for all species. However, positive correlations were observed among species within microsites, indicating that these two components cannot consistently explain the variation in RGR(M). Both NAR and LWR affect interspecific, but not intraspecific, variation in RGR(M). Leaf life span was negatively correlated with either RGR(M) or RGR(H) in both inter- and intraspecific comparisons. Species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth rates, particularly in resource-rich environments. Consequently, leaf life span is a good predictor of seedling RGR. Leaf life span affects plant performance and has a strong and consistent effect on tree seedling growth, even among contrasting environments.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0912-3814;;WOS:000286431900018;

Two-year-old olive trees, grown in pots in greenhouse, were not watered for 2 months. Relative growth rate (RGR), leaf water potential (I(LW)) and the leaf relative water content (LWC) of the two cultivars decreased with increasing water stress. Zalmati showed higher values of RGR and LWC and lower decreased values of I(LW) than Chemlali, in response to water deficit, particularly during severe drought stress. Water stress also caused a marked decline on photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll fluorescence. The net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F (v)/F (m)) and the intrinsic efficiency of open PSII reaction centres (F' (v)/F' (m)) decreased as drought stress developed. In addition, drought conditions, reduced leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids contents especially at severe water stress. However, Zalmati plants were the less affected when compared with Chemlali. In both cultivars, stomatal control was the major factor affecting photosynthesis under moderate drought stress. At severe drought-stress levels, the non-stomatal component of photosynthesis is inhibited and inactivation of the photosystem II occurs. Leaf anatomical parameters show that drought stress resulted in an increase of the upper epidermis and palisade mesophyll thickness as well as an increase of the stomata and trichomes density. These changes were more characteristic in cv. 'Zalmati'. Zalmati leaves also revealed lower specific leaf area and had higher density of foliar tissue. From the behaviour of Zalmati plants, with a smaller reduction in relative growth rate, net assimilation rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and with a thicker palisade parenchyma, and a higher stomatal and trichome density, we consider this cultivar more drought-tolerant than cv. Chemlali and therefore, very promising for cultivation in arid areas.;;;;;;;;;11;0;11;1;12;0137-5881;;WOS:000285997900004;

The ornamental plant trade, forestry, and agriculture have been responsible for the initial introduction of over 60% of invasive alien plant species. Screening tools to test potentially new horticultural species should help curtail the continued introduction of new invaders.2. Using two methods for analysing phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of known invasive and non-invasive, exotic woody horticultural species, we tested the potential of relative growth rate (RGR) and related traits including net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), and specific leaf area (SLA) as predictors of invasiveness. These 29 PICs include 65 species and broadly cover angiosperms.3. Without accounting for phylogeny, no significant differences were found in seedling RGR or related traits between invasive and non-invasive woody species. Using PICs, invasive species' RGRs were significantly higher. RGR was considerably more significant using our extensive dataset than in previous smaller studies, while SLA and LAR remained marginally significant. NAR was significantly higher for invasives for the 10-20 days interval.4. Analysis of this broad data set confirms that RGR is significantly higher for invasive woody species than their non-invasive counterparts, and may serve as a useful biological predictor of invasiveness for woody angiosperms. This expanded study shows that plant species use different physiological and biomass allocation patterns to achieve higher RGR; therefore individual components of RGR, such as SLA, do not consistently predict potential invasiveness of species.5. Synthesis and applications. Comparative seedling RGR studies show that this measure has potential as a screening tool for new exotic plant species. Unfortunately, more easily measurable components of RGR do not consistently predict invasiveness, as previously thought. Using seedling RGR analysis as an invasive species' screening tool requires growing a species proposed for introduction with related invasive and non-invasive species. If the tested species' RGR is higher or not significantly different from its known invasive counterpart, it should be considered highly likely to become invasive, and excluded from further consideration as a potential horticultural species. Seedling RGR could potentially produce a useful, straightforward screening tool when phylogenetically related species or cultivars are available.";;;;;;;;;12;0;12;1;13;0021-8901;;WOS:000283983200019;

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.7.

Relative growth rate was not significantly different between the two groups but water use efficiency (WUE) was higher in the native species while the converse was observed for light use efficiency (quantum efficiency, AQE) and maximum photosynthesis on a mass basis (A(maxmass)). The invasive species, as a group, also exhibited higher respiration load, higher light compensation point and higher specific leaf area. There were stronger correlations of leaf traits and greater structural (but not physiological) plasticity in invasive species than in their native counterparts. The scaling coefficients of resource use efficiencies (WUE, AQE and respiration efficiency) as well as those of fitness (biomass accumulated) versus many of the performance traits examined did not differ between the two species-origin groups, but there were indications of significant shifts in elevation (intercept values) and shifts along common slopes in many of these relationships - signalling differences in carbon economy (revenue returned per unit energy invested) and/or resource usage. Using ordination and based on 14 ecophysiological attributes, a fair level of separation between the two groups was achieved (51.5% explanatory power), with AQE, light compensation point, respiration load, WUE, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio, in decreasing order, being the main drivers.

Embothrium coccineum is one of the few light-demanding tree species in the temperate rainforest of southern South America, and seedlings are frequently attacked by insects and snails. Herbivory may contribute to the exclusion of E. coccineum from the shade if 1) herbivory pressure is greater in the shade, which in turn can result from shade plants being less resistant or from habitat preferences of herbivores, and/or 2) consequences of damage are more detrimental in the shade, i.e., shade plants are less tolerant. We tested this in a field study with naturally established seedlings in treefall gaps (sun) and forest understory (shade) in a temperate rainforest of southern Chile. Seedlings growing in the sun sustained nearly 40% more herbivore damage and displayed half of the specific leaf area than those growing in the shade. A palatability test showed that a generalist snail consumed ten times more leaf area when fed on shade leaves compared to sun leaves, i.e., plant resistance was greater in sun-grown seedlings. Herbivore abundance (total biomass) was two-fold greater in treefall gaps compared to the forest understory. Undamaged seedlings survived better and showed a slightly higher growth rate in the sun. Whereas simulated herbivory in the shade decreased seedling survival and growth by 34% and 19%, respectively, damaged and undamaged seedlings showed similar survival and growth in the sun. Leaf tissue lost to herbivores in the shade appears to be too expensive to replace under the limiting light conditions of forest understory. Following evaluations of herbivore abundance and plant resistance and tolerance in contrasting light environments, we have shown how herbivory on a light-demanding tree species may contribute to its exclusion from shade sites. Thus, in the shaded forest understory, where the seedlings of some tree species are close to their physiological tolerance limit, herbivory could play an important role in plant establishment.;;;;;;;;;12;0;9;1;12;1932-6203;;WOS:000279589300008;20628638

There are three models that predict contrasting compensatory growth responses of plants to herbivory, and resource availability: (1) Growth rate model. (2) Compensatory continuum hypothesis and (3) Limiting resource model. The predictions of these three models were tested on the tree Brosimum alicastrum and the liana Vitis tiliifolia. Seedlings were subjected to three levels of experimental defoliation (0%, 50%, and 90% leaf removal) along a light resource gradient (1%, 9% and 65%, of full Sun). In both species. defoliation significantly increased leaf production rate and relative growth rate of leaf area, but, not. of biomass. Net assimilation rate was the strongest driver of biomass growth in both species, but leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were also important in B. alicastrum. Compensatory responses of leaf area growth in B. alicastrum were significant, greater in higher than lower light availability consistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis predictions, but in contrast to the growth rate model predictions. The limiting resource model offered an explanation for all possible experimental outcomes by directly considering the effects of environmental differences in resource availability.;;;;;;;;;3;1;3;0;4;0266-4674;;WOS:000274986000004;

However, this does not usually occur in other species, e.g., Ulmus pumila and Zizyphus jujuba. We compared stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) as indicators of leaf water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf area- and mass-based nitrogen content (N-area and N-mass) by tree height (1, 5, and 10 m) in P. hopeinsis, R. pseudoacacia, U. pumila, and Z jujuba. In P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, leaf delta C-13 and N-area were significantly lower in 10-m trees than in 1-m saplings, indicating that leaf WUE and photosynthetic rates of both species decreased with tree height. In contrast, delta C-13 in Z. jujuba varied little with tree height. The delta C-13 of 10-m-tall U. pumila trees was significantly higher than that of 1-m plants, demonstrating an increase in WUE with tree height. Decreasing WUE, leaf N-area and N-mass with height increases in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia may be related to water and nutrient limitations for these species in semiarid regions. in contrast, stable or increasing delta C-13 with tree height in U. pumila and Z jujuba may account (to some extent) for successful production of these species under identical environmental conditions. Diameter growth rate also decreased with maturity in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, but increased or was stable for U. pumila and Z. jujuba. The differences in leaf WUE and LMA among species with tree maturity may be related to species' growth patterns and susceptibility to drought stress, and are likely to be important new criteria for plantation species selection on the Loess Plateau.

Baker, a commercially important eucalypt grown in short-rotation coppice cultivation and harvested for its foliar 1,8-cineole oil. Micropropagation of elite E. polybractea trees has resulted in selection gains for foliar oil traits, but decreased above-ground biomass accumulation has been observed in clones compared to related half-sibling families. This study aims to use a greenhouse study to investigate if micropropagation induces somaclonal variation that can account for the reduction in above-ground biomass in E. polybractea clones. Secondly, the study aims to compare the coppicing, ability of micropropagated clones with related half-sibling seedlings using detopped plantation-grown saplings. The results of the greenhouse study suggest that micropropagation of E. polybractea induces somaclonal variation that manifests in more mature leaf morphologies such as increased foliar oil concentrations and lower specific leaf area (SLA), attributable to an isobilateral arrangement of increased palisade mesophyll layers. Lower SLA. rather than differences in root allocation, is likely to be a key contributor to the lower relative growth rates observed in early sapling growth of micropropagated clones. In the field study, all micropropagated and seedling-derived E. polybractea saplings coppiced vigorously in the 12 months after de-topping. The coppice growth was so vigorous in the 12 months after de-topping that total above-ground biomass equalled that of the 27-month-old saplings, irrespective of propagation source. The morphological distinction between leaves of micropropagated and seed-derived plants was no longer evident in the coppice regrowth. The results presented here suggest that the micropropagated leaf morphology and the resultant growth reduction is transient and micropropagated plants coppice just as vigorously as seed-derived plants. Therefore, micropropagation is unlikely to detrimentally influence above-ground biomass accumulation beyond the first harvest rotation.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0829-318X;;WOS:000274405400012;20022865

This diminishing returns in SLA may result from changes in the relative numbers of different shoot types bearing leaves with different SLAs as trees increase in overall size. This ontogenetic shift hypothesis was examined for 15 Acer rubrum trees differing in basal stem diameter (0.01 m <= D <= 0.62 m). Detailed analyses of the largest tree showed that short-shoots produced leaves with significantly smaller SLA than the leaves produced by long-shoots regardless of the location of shoots within the canopy. A combination of random effect and split-plot (main-effect) ANOVA models showed that >94% of the variance observed for SLA was attributable to shoot type rather than to the location of leaves in the canopy. Further, with increasing trunk diameter, the number of short-shoots increased rapidly relative to the number of long-shoots. Although the leaves of short-shoots gain disproportionately more surface area per unit mass investment compared to the leaves produced by long-shoots, our data show that ontogenetic shifts occurring at the shoot and whole plant level account for size-dependent decreases in total canopy SLA.;;;;;;;;;9;0;8;0;9;f_vr-22;;WOS:000273523700003;21622364

This research was aimed at comparing the growth of two propagule types, seedlings and stecklings, of Khaya senegalensis subjected to four irrigation regimes, 25, 50, 75 and 100% field capacity in Burkina Faso. The relative growth rate, biomass allocation and intrinsic water use efficiency of the propagules were assessed in a full-factorial pot experiment in block design. Except the relative growth rate of stem basal diameter and specific leaf area, for which mean values were significantly higher for seedlings than stecklings, the two propagule types had similar growth patterns regarding relative growth rates of stem length, leaf, stem, root and the total plant biomass. There was no significant difference between propagule types concerning biomass fraction to total plant biomass of leaf, stem and root, root to stem ratio, leaf area productivity and carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C). However, the irrigation regimes significantly affected all parameters. In contrast to 75 and 100% field capacity irrigation regimes, the low water supply of 25 and 50% field capacity resulted in plant stress, which was evident from the significant reduction in plant growth and biomass production and an increase in the root biomass to total plant biomass ratio and delta(13)C. It can be concluded that seedlings and stecklings have comparable growth patterns, while water stress is a major growth-limiting factor highlighting the need for selecting drought and borer resistant genotypes for successful plantations.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0037-5330;;WOS:000286497200004;

Bud break occurred when mean air temperature was 14.1 +/- A 1.2A degrees C, and it was immediately followed by the increase of leaf area and leaf dry mass. The highest leaf expansion rates happened during the first 22 days of the process. Leaf area and leaf dry mass reached the steady-state value 46 and 62 days after bud break, respectively. Net photosynthesis increased from bud break to full leaf expansion, and total chlorophyll content had the same trend, confirmed by the correlation between the two variables. Leaf dark respiration peaked during the first 11 days of leaf expansion, then decreased and reached a steady-state value 34 days after bud break. R. alaternus completed cell division and cell enlargement of the epidermal tissue 28 days after bud break, and the ones of the mesophyll tissue at full leaf expansion. The results underline that morphological, anatomical and physiological leaf traits in R. alaternus are indicative of a less sclerophyllous species (i.e. higher specific leaf area) compared with other Mediterranean evergreen species. Moreover, the higher fraction of mesophyll volume occupied by the intercellular air spaces, and the ability to end the leaf expansion process before air temperature might be a limiting factor, makes R. alaternus closer to the mesophyte species.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0931-1890;;WOS:000271504800012;

It is, therefore, important to investigate whether and how life-history traits of species invasive in such habitats differ from those of species that are only invasive in disturbed and resource rich habitats. We compared the growth of seedlings of native and invasive tree species from nutrient-poor secondary forests in the tropical Seychelles. We hypothesised that the relative performance of the two groups would change predictably along resource gradients, with native species performing better at low levels of resource availability and invasive species performing better at higher levels. To test this hypothesis, we performed a common garden experiment using seedlings of six invasive and seven native tree species grown under three levels of light (65, 11 and 3.5% of ambient light) and two of nutrients (low and high). Due to large variation among species, differences in growth rates (RGR) were not significant among seedlings of the native and the invasive species. However, seedlings of the invasive species showed higher specific leaf areas (SLA) and higher leaf nutrient contents than seedlings of the native species. They also exhibited greater plasticity in biomass and nutrient allocation (i.e., greater plasticity in LAR, RSR and leaf nutrient contents) in response to varying resource availability. However, differences between the mean values of these parameters were generally small compared with variation within groups. We conclude that successful invaders on nutrient-poor soils in the Seychelles are either stress-tolerant, possessing growth traits similar to those of the native species, or fast-growing but adapted to nutrient-poor soils. In contrast, the more typical, fast-growing alien species with no particular adaptations to nutrient-poor soils seem to be restricted to relative nutrient-rich sites in the lowlands. The finding-that some introduced species thrive in resource-poor habitats-suggests that undisturbed habitats with low resource availability may be less resistant to plant invasions than was previously supposed.;;;;;;;;;28;0;28;0;29;1387-3547;;WOS:000269529100017;

In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the plant-water relationships of Jotropha seedlings from different accessions under different levels of drought stress. There was little difference in plant-water relations between accessions. Drought significantly reduced leaf area, biomass and relative growth rate, but had no effect on specific leaf area, daily range in leaf water potential, leaf water content, transpiration efficiency or aboveground biomass water productivity, corrected for atmospheric conditions. Stem wood density was equally low (0.26 g cm(-3)) for all treatments. Stem water content was lowest for dry treatment seedlings. Based on these results, Jatropha could be characterized as a stem-succulent tree. In contrast to other stem-succulent deciduous trees, leaves were not shed immediately after the seedlings were confronted with drought. Instead, at the onset of drought, leaves with a higher adaxial stomatal density were formed, after which leaves were only gradually shed. The role of the succulent stem in the water economy of Jatropha was confined to balancing the small water losses of the leaves during drought. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutrient limitation of seedling growth on contrasting soils from Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. A pot bioassay experiment was established to test the hypotheses that different soil types represented on a 50 ha plot in Pasoh Forest Reserve supply different amounts of nutrients for plant growth, and that phosphorus (P) is the main limiting nutrient. Seedlings of the tree Lagerstroemia floribunda were grown for 54 days in pots of alluvial, shale or laterised-shale soil. The experiment comprised six nutrient addition treatments and an unmanipulated control, with five replicates for each treatment. The growth of seedlings of L. floribunda was limited by the availability of P but not by the other nutrients (N, K, Ca or Mg) added singly in the experiment. Relative growth rates were highest on alluvial and shale-derived soils, which had higher available P concentrations than the laterised shale-derived soils in the absence of nutrient addition. Shifts in biomass allocation and changes to specific leaf area were the mechanisms responsible for the increase in plant growth in response to nutrient addition.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0128-1283;;WOS:000271433000005;

Here we focused on the effects of variability in both amount and frequency of water supply on juvenile root and leaf functional traits and growth of seven Mediterranean shrub species occurring in arid SE Spain, Anthyllis cytisoides, Atriplex halimus, Ephedra fragilis, Genista umbellata, Lycium intricatum, Retama sphaerocarpa, and Salsola oppositifolia. In a 14-month greenhouse experiment we manipulated water supply expecting that reduced water amount and pulses of watering of different magnitude affected functional traits and seedling growth, even if the amount of water provided was the same. Different watering patterns altered soil drying dynamics, with reduced supply of water amount and frequent watering becoming the driest treatment. We found that roots of all species responded to alterations in water supply by changing biomass allocation patterns (i.e., higher root-to-shoot mass [R:S] ratio in droughted plants), and by altering fine roots diameter, measured in terms of specific root length. Indeed, differences in growth rate among species were significantly linked to fine roots diameter and biomass allocation, which relates to uptake capacity of roots. However, relative growth rate and leaf traits such as specific leaf area were insensitive, likely because prolonged droughts over longer periods of time seem necessary to constraint growth in all these arid shrubs.;;;;;;;;;17;2;15;0;18;1385-0237;;WOS:000269209400009;

Sapling architecture may be an important determinant of performance traits, such as light interception and height growth, but few studies have examined the direct relationship between sapling architecture and growth properties. To study this relationship and the potential for strategic diversification, we analysed the growth properties in saplings of 16 Bornean tree species that differ in architecture.2. Annual net production significantly differed amongst species and was positively correlated with total above-ground dry mass, total leaf area and crown area. In contrast, the net assimilation rate was weakly but negatively correlated with these architectural traits. The net assimilation rate was virtually independent of leaf size and specific leaf area. Relationships between sapling architecture and relative growth rate in mass were weak.3. The relative growth rate in height did not significantly differ amongst species, although their total dry mass, a proxy for extension cost, varied fourfold across species for a given sapling height. This is because the proportional increase in net production with total dry mass, which is based on a larger total leaf area and larger crown area, cancelled out the higher extension cost. All architectural traits, including leaf size and specific leaf area, failed to predict height growth rate.4. Synthesis. Relative growth rates in both mass and height were relatively independent of sapling architecture. Of the architectural traits, leaf size, specific leaf area and stem diameter were poor predictors of growth properties, even though they were considered functionally important. These results clearly reject the classic hypothesis that architectural variation leads to a trade-off between height growth and light interception, at least for the species that are under shaded conditions. However, functional variation ranging from species with high net production and low net assimilation rates (in saplings of equal height) to species with the opposite traits, which was accompanied by architectural variation in total dry mass and related size factors, may be important for the coexistence of these tree species. The possibility that small total dry mass may be advantageous in height growth under well-lit conditions should be examined in future studies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0022-0477;;WOS:000268928200017;

Here we compare patterns of leaf phenology, stem radial growth and branch growth of co-occurring savanna and forest trees in the Cerrado region of central Brazil to gain insight into the influence of these parameters in forest-savanna boundary dynamics. We hypothesized that forest species would have higher radial growth rates but later leaf flush than savanna species.We studied 12 congeneric species pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species. All individuals were growing in savanna conditions under full sun. We measured specific leaf area (SLA), light-saturated photosynthesis and monthly increments in stem circumference, branch length, leaf flush and leaf fall.Relative to savanna species, forest species had 68% higher diameter growth rates, 38% higher SLA, and displayed a greater crown area for a given basal area. Across species, radial growth was positively correlated with SLA (r(2) = 0 center dot 31), but not with CO(2) assimilation.Peak leaf production of savanna species was in the late dry season, 1 month earlier than for forest species, which suggests a strategy to avoid nutrient losses during leaf expansion due to herbivory or leaching. However, savanna and forest species did not differ in annual branch growth, number of leaves produced per branch, or in timing of leaf fall.Radial growth was tightly coupled to monthly rainfall in forest species whereas the growth of savanna species ceased before the end of the wet season. The cessation of above-ground growth at a time of active photosynthesis may reflect a shift in allocation to roots and reserves.These results contribute to recent studies showing that savanna and forest species represent different functional types and that despite the limiting resources in savanna environments, forest trees that invade the savanna tend to present higher growth rates and larger and denser crowns, which enhance shading and could promote changes in equilibrium of forest-savanna boundaries.;;;;;;;;;38;3;38;4;43;0269-8463;;WOS:000267539000005;

However, the mechanisms that determine differential species performance in response to light and soil resource availability are poorly understood. To examine responses to light and soil nutrient availability, we grew seedlings of five tropical tree species for 12 mo at < 2 and 18 percent full sunlight and in two soil types representing natural contrasts in nutrient availability within a lowland dipterocarp forest in North Borneo. We chose two specialists of nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils, respectively, and one habitat generalist. Across all species, growth was higher in high than low light and on more nutrient rich soil. Although species differed in growth rates, the ranking of species, in terms of growth, was consistent across the four treatments. Nutrient-rich soils improved seedling survival and increased growth of three species even under low light. Slower-growing species increased root allocation and reduced specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) in response to decreased nutrient supply. All species increased LAR in response to low light. Maximum growth rates were negatively correlated with survival in the most resource-limited environment. Nutrient-poor soil specialists had low maximum growth rates but high survival at low resource availability. Specialists of nutrient-rich soils, plus the habitat generalist, had the opposite suite of traits. Fitness component trade-offs may be driven by both light and belowground resource availability. These trade-offs contribute to differentiation of tropical tree species among habitats defined by edaphic variation.;;;;;;;;;16;0;16;0;16;juin-06;;WOS:000267538200005;

Removal plots had a lower leaf area index, higher air temperatures, higher afternoon soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity than control plots. Removal plots had 40% less litterfall mass and similarly reduced nutrient inputs. Leaf litter decomposition rates were much slower in the removal plots, due more to site quality than litter quality.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils.We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.;;;;;;;;;203;13;200;0;219;d_c-15;;WOS:000263566600006;

In nature, LMA varies more than 100-fold among species. Part of this variation (c. 35%) can be ascribed to differences between functional groups, with evergreen species having the highest LMA, but most of the variation is within groups or biomes. When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO(2) concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes.New Phytologist (2009) 182: 565-588doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02830.x.;;;;;;;;;346;14;331;1;361;0028-646X;;WOS:000265229400004;19434804

Liana effects may depend on the availability of above- and below-ground resources and differ between tree species. We conducted a shade house experiment to test the effect of light (4% and 35% full sun, using neutral-density screen) on the competitive interactions between seedlings of one liana, (Byttneria grandifolia) and three tree species (two shade-tolerant trees, Litsea dilleniifolia and Pometia tomentosa, and one light-demanding tree. Bauhinia variegata) and to evaluate the contribution of both above- and below-ground competition. Trees were grown in four competition treatments with the liana: no competition. root competition. shoot competition and root and shoot competition. Light: strongly affected leaf photosynthetic capacity (light-saturated photosynthetic rate, P-n), growth and most morphological traits of the tree species. Liana-induced competition resulted in reduced P-n, total leaf areas and relative growth rates (RGR) of the three tree species. The relative importance of above- and below-ground competition differed between the two light levels. In low light. RGR of the three tree species was reduced more strongly by shoot competition (23.1-28.7% reduction) than by root competition (5.3-26.4%). In high tight. in contrast, root competition rather than shoot competition greatly reduced RGR. Liana competition affected most morphological traits (except for specific leaf area and leaf area ratio of Litsea and Pometia), and differentially altered patterns of biomass allocation in the tree seedlings. These findings suggest that competition from liana seedlings can greatly suppress growth in tree seedlings of both light-demanding and shade-tolerant species and those effects differ with competition type (below- and above-ground) and with irradiance.;;;;;;;;;10;0;10;1;11;0266-4674;;WOS:000259950800006;

We analyzed responsiveness to light and nutrient availability of five Bauhinia species (three lianas and two trees). Seedlings were grown in a shade house in two light regimes (5 and 25% Of full Sunlight) and two nutrient Supply regimes (field soil and N fertilization equivalent to 100 kg ha(-1)), and important growth-related physiological and morphological plant parameters were measured. Light availability affected most of the measured variables, whereas N addition had only weak effects. In the four light-demanding species (two lianas and two trees), relative plant biomass growth rate increased and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with increased light availability, whereas a shade-tolerant liana did not respond. Leaf N concentration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area increased in response to increased irradiance or soil N in the light-demanding tree species and the shade-tolerant liana, but not in the two light-demanding lianas. The light-demanding lianas also had higher SLA and leaf mass ratio, resulting in a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) in high light, whereas the light-demanding trees did not. Across all treatments, mean plasticity indices of physiological and morphological traits, and all traits combined were similar among the studied species. Plasticity was higher in response to light than to N, indicating that light is the main factor controlling seedling responses of the Studied species. Although lianas and trees did not differ in mean plasticity in response to light and N, the light-demanding lianas were phenotypically less plastic in LAR and in photosynthetic rates and biomass allocation than the trees. Light and N interacted in their effects on most physiological variables, but the consequences for relative growth rate differed little among species. We conclude that, contrary to Our predictions, lianas were no more responsive to variation in light and N availability than trees.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0829-318X;;WOS:000258841300014;18519259

Since lianas are exposed to a very heterogeneous light environment, they could be expected to express morphological and physiological plasticity in response to changes in the light environment, as high as that found in pioneer trees. We compared the biomass allocation and photosynthetic responses of seedlings of three species of lianas and two species of pioneer trees to increased light availability. Seedlings were transferred from medium (4-5 mol m(-2) d(-1)) to high irradiance (12-15 mol m(-2) d(-1)) in a controlled environment. In general the three liana species allocated fewer resources to the stem in comparison with the trees. The difference in the response between irradiance regimes was similar among the species, with no strong differences between trees and lianas probably due the early stage of the plants. With increase in irradiance plants accumulated more biomass, allocated more resources to the roots and less to the leaves, reduced the leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA). The photosynthetic rates recorded were not related to the rates of growth as measured by the increase in dry biomass (RGRm). Regardless of the life form, plants under higher irradiance increased their light compensation point (Lcp) and attained light saturation (Lsp) at higher levels of irradiance, while the saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) did not show a clear pattern, and dark respiration (R(d)) and quantum yield (Q) were not affected by the transference. The understanding of liana and tree seedlings responses to the light environment may have important implications in the dynamics of tropical forest regeneration. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. in both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species. The effect of phylogeny in trait covariation was unimportant, in fact, a mixture of clades was represented in several groups among the species they contained, suggesting among-lineage convergence.

Evidence from five Neotropical forests;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;89;7;;;1908;1920;;10.1890/07-0207.1;;;juil-08;2008;A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests.There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival.Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.;;;;;;;;;124;4;122;0;130;d_c-58;;WOS:000258007500013;18705377

The hypotheses were tested that the degree of branching (L(TB)) correlates with leaf traits and that height growth rate is negatively correlated with the degree of branching and leaf life span (LLS) by examining saplings of live canopy and subcanopy species, two shrub species and one invasive subshrub species (Clidemia hirta) in a tropical rain forest, West Java, Indonesia. Of the eight species, the most and least branched species were Castanopsis acuminatissima and Macaranga semiglobosa, respectively. Leaf traits examined were leaf size, LLS, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen concentration per mass (N(mass)) and per area. LLS tended to be positively correlated with LMA, and negatively correlated with N(mass). Leaf size was negatively correlated with LTB, but the other leaf traits were not correlated with L(TB). The height growth of the eight species was low, irrespective of L(TB) and LLS, for understorey individuals. The height growth of gap individuals was negatively correlated with LLS for the eight species, and also negatively with LTB for the seven species other than one subshrub species. Thus, the degree of branching was correlated with leaf size only among the five leaf traits, and both leaf life span and the degree of branching affected the height growth of gap individuals, except for the subshrub species.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0266-4674;;WOS:000258043300008;

The temperate evergreens Nothofaglis nitida and N. dol?ibeyi are differentially distributed on soil moisture gradients, only the former being common on poorly-drained sites. We compared the relative height growth rate (RGRm) and foliage loss of seedlings subjected experimentally to normal drainage (soil at field capacity), sudden waterlogging and gradual waterlogging for two months to determine which waterlogging regime more accurately predicts interspecific differences in tolerance, as evident from natural distributions. RGRH was similar between species but differed between treatments (normal watering > gradual waterlogging = sudden waterlogging). Sudden waterlogging caused massive foliage loss in the two species, but gradual waterlogging caused much greater foliage loss i n N. dombeyi than in N. nitida, indicating some degree of acclimation by the latter species. Linear regressions indicated that RGRH was negatively affected by foliage loss in both species, without differences between thern. Since no difference in RGR(H) was found between species in the waterlogging treatments, but yet in foliage loss, other mechanisms may be involved in the short term growth reduction of N. nitida. Effects of waterlogging on long-term performance in the field were evaluated by reciprocal transplants between a poorly-drained site naturally occupied by N. nitida, and a well drained site naturally occupied by N. dombevi. After two growing seasons, N. dombeyi had significantly lower specific leaf area (SLA) and RGR HI at the poorly drained site than at its original site. At the poorly drained site N. nitida achieved 100 % survival, compared with 73.5 % in N. dombeyi. Reduced growth and survival of N. dombeyi associated with the negative effects on carbon gain of extensive foliage loss and reduced SLA may thus exclude it from the wetter sites. We conclude that tolerance may be better predicted from responses to gradual, rather than sudden waterlogging.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0716-078X;;WOS:000257600400008;

Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL.

Observed differences in traits and responses to light confirmed a contrasting ecology at the seedling stage in Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica in consonance with differences in their overall distribution.

Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance.

However, theoretically, SLA by itself has small net positive effect on RGR because any increase in SLA inevitably causes a decrease in area-based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNCa), another RGR component. It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNCa.Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis.SLA varied 1.9-fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a 47% decrease in LNCa along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9-fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNCa. Consequently, LNCa values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA-RGR relationship was achieved.These results highlight the importance of leaf-root interactions in understanding interspecific differences in RGR.;;;;;;;;;19;1;18;1;20;0028-646X;;WOS:000257570400015;19086290

Seedlings raised in polyethylene bags containing about 4 kg of garden soil were subjected to four watering frequencies by irrigating daily and at 7, 14 and 21 days intervals, respectively designated as no stress, intermediate, high and very high stress. Periodical observations began one month after seedling establishment. Seedling height and dry biomass decreased at very high stress in all species. The reduction (relative to no. stress) in height and biomass was maximum in L. leucocephala (75.8% and 99.8%) and minimum in A. lebbek (53.8% and 81.6%). The average single leaf area also decreased significantly with increasing water stress. The specific leaf area increased with increasing water stress in all species except for S. robusta, which showed a reverse pattern. The leaf area ratio increased along with moisture stress (except for S. robusta). A reverse pattern was found in relative growth rate and net assimilation rate in all species (except for S. robusta and T. grandis). Under very high stress, L. leucocephala maintained higher Psi and proline content and A. lebbek showed lower values indicating, respectively, their drought resistance and susceptibility. The osmotic adjustment in different species under very high stress was in the order: L. leucocephala > T grandis > D. sissoo > S. robusta and > A. lebbek. Generally, net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate decreased and stomatal resistance increased in very high water stress compared to no stress in all species. The percent reduction (relative to maximum) in photosynthesis under severe moisture stress was highest in A. lebbek and lowest in L. leucocephala and T. grandis, whereas transpiration rate was highest in T grandis and lowest in L. leucocephala indicating that the latter is more drought resistant.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0564-3295;;BCI:BCI200800705583;

Tree growth and leaf characteristics, as well as the links between them, were intensively studied for 3 weeks. The R deltoides x R trichocarpa family was more productive than the P deltoides x R nigra family at both sites. The two families inherited complementary leaf characteristics from their respective male parents, i.e., large leaves from P trichocarpa and fast leaf production from P nigra. The traits were clearly dependent on site conditions, trees being much bigger in Italy than in France. Moreover, the G x E interaction caused a significant change in the genotypic ranking between sites in terms of productivity for the R deltoides x P trichocarpa family, which might represent a limit for the selection of productive hybrids showing a large environmental spectrum. Three categories of leaf traits could be considered: (i) traits linked to whole tree growth irrespective of site and family (e.g. leaf area, petiole dimensions), (ii) traits for which the relationships with tree growth were dependent on site and/or family (e.g., specific leaf area, nitrogen content, leaf number increment), and (iii) traits showing no link with tree growth irrespective of site and family (e.g., chlorophyll and carbon contents).

Here we use data from 2021 species at 175 sites around the world from the GLOPNET compilation to show that key physiological traits that are difficult to measure (such as photosynthetic capacity) can be predicted from simple qualitative plant characteristics, climate information, easily measured (""soft"") leaf traits, or all of these in combination. The qualitative plant functional type (PFT) attributes examined are phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), growth form (grass, herb, shrub, or tree), and leaf phenology (deciduous vs. evergreen). These three PFT attributes explain between one-third and two-thirds of the variation in each of five quantitative leaf ecophysiological traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf life span, mass-based net photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)) nitrogen content (N-mass) and phosphorus content (P-mass). Alternatively, the combination of four simple, widely available climate metrics (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean vapor pressure deficit, and solar irradiance) explain only 5-20% of the variation in those same five leaf traits. Adding the climate metrics to the qualitative PFTs as independent factors in the model increases explanatory power by 3-11 % for the five traits. If a single easily measured leaf trait (SLA) is also included in the model along with qualitative plant traits and climate metrics, an additional 5-25% of the variation in the other four other leaf traits is explained, with the models accounting for 62%, 65%, 66%, and 73% of global variation in N-mass, P-mass, A(mass), and leaf life span, respectively. Given the wide availability of the summary climate data and qualitative PFT data used in these analyses, they could be used to explain roughly half of global variation in the less accessible leaf traits (A(mass), leaf life span, N-mass P-mass); this can be augmented to two-thirds of all variation if climatic and PFT data are used in combination with the readily measured trait SLA. This shows encouraging possibilities of progress in developing general predictive equations for macro-ecology, global scaling, and global modeling.";;;;;;;;;65;4;61;0;72;1051-0761;;WOS:000250142500011;17974336

Functional traits contribute to the success of invasive plants. These traits can reflect inherent properties or they can be new adaptations from evolutionary responses to escape from natural enemies of the introduced range. We tested the hypothesis that genetic shifts in morphological and physiological traits have occurred between native and invasive populations of Sapium sebiferum.2. Sapium sebiferum seedlings were grown in a greenhouse using seed collected from four populations of its introduced range (US) and four from native Chinese populations that are thought to be genetic candidates of the introduced populations. We examined plant biomass production, relative growth rate (RGR), relative stem height growth rate (RHR), root : shoot ratio (RSR), total number of leaves (TLN) and leaf area (TLA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net CO2 assimilation (A) and shoot specific respiration rate (R-D).3. US populations of S. sebiferum differed from Chinese populations for most plant variables. Final shoot and total biomass, as well as, RGRs of invasive (US) populations were significantly greater than those of native (Chinese) populations, although RHR and TLN per seedling did not differ between them. Root : shoot ratios (RSR) were significantly lower, while leaf traits including TLA, LAR and SLA were generally greater for invasive populations compared to native populations. Net CO2 A was significantly higher for invasive populations than for native populations, but no significant difference in R-D was found between two population types.4. Of 13 measured plant variables, RSRs, TLA and CO2 A were identified as traits that contributed the most to differences observed between native Chinese and invasive US populations. The suite of morphological and physiological traits functioning together may result in different growth strategies for native versus invasive populations. By virtue of these traits, invasive populations of S. sebiferum may use soil resources and light more efficiently than native populations, which may have given rise to their competitive superiority in the introduced range.;;;;;;;;;38;5;37;0;43;0269-8463;;WOS:000247905700012;

The objectives were to identify key traits for successful establishment, defined in terms of above-ground biomass production, and to characterize the degree of niche overlap with respect to the use of above-ground resources, such as light and space. Four months after sowing, 15 species reached an above-ground biomass of more than 400 g m(-2). Highly productive monocultures adopted extremely different strategies of space filling in terms of canopy height, biomass density and centre of gravity of vertical biomass distribution. Regression tree analysis identified (1) the number of seedlings and (2) a trade-off between the development of a large number of small-sized shoots of species with intensive clonal growth in contrast to the establishment of fewer large-sized shoots as the two most important traits for successful establishment. Further variables associated with high above-ground biomass production by individual species were traits known to be relevant to the relative growth rate of herbaceous species, such as specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen or allocation between shoots and roots. The principle finding of this study is that the success of the 15 most productive species was not based on a single pathway but on a variable combination of traits. There are clearly many possible combinations of morphological and physiological features that will result in a species becoming productive, and these combinations differ among species in a local species pool.;;;;;;;;;9;0;8;0;9;0029-8549;;WOS:000246614700005;17356814

T. superba had the lowest relative growth rate (RGR) at 10% sunlight and greatest net assimilation rate (NAR) at 100% sunlight; although a higher RGR at this light level was not seen for this species. Strong and positive linear mean A(max)-mean NAR relationship of C. odorata and T. superba indicated that differences in leaf photosynthetic rates of the two species were reflected in their NAR, which increased with increasing light. At final harvest, superior biomass production was found at 45% sunlight for all the species. Seedling responses in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, leaf mass ratio and root mass ratio were typically those found along a light gradient. At the 100% sunlight, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE), F-v/F-m and final root system of the plants was generally superior in T. superba but at 10% sunlight, WUE was inferior in T. superba when compared to C. odorata and M. altissima, reflecting the respective species' short-term acclimation to high or low light.

Invasive species were hypothesized to have highher seedling relative growth rates (RGRs) and specific leaf areas (SLAs) than did related less-invasive species. In phylogenetically independent contrasts conducted among taxa within families, high seedling RGRs and SLAs have significant positive associations with woody plant invasiveness. For contrasts containing species invasive in mediterranean regions, invasive species had significantly larger root biomass allocation than did less-invasive species.

Sonoran Desert winter annuals exhibit striking year-to-year variation in population dynamics that is driven by variable precipitation, but species differ in the strength of demographic response to precipitation and hence in the degree of temporal variance in population dynamics. To understand the physiological mechanisms of differing population dynamic responses to environmental variation, we investigated interspecific differences in functional traits that mediate responsiveness to precipitation.We conducted sequential harvests throughout the growing season to examine relative growth rate and biomass allocation patterns. We then related growth parameters to leaf-level carbon isotope discrimination (a time-integrated measure of water-use efficiency) and long-term demographic variation.We hypothesized that water-use efficiency should trade-off with rapid growth rates. Furthermore, we hypothesized that species having efficient water use should have buffered population dynamics in dry years but sacrifice high growth and fecundity in wet years, resulting in low long-term variance in demographic success. Conversely, species with high growth capacity should be very responsive to infrequent periods of high precipitation and thus exhibit high temporal variance.Species differed in seasonal relative growth rate and allocation patterns. Species with the highest relative growth rates rapidly deployed large leaf area displays following mid-season rainfall. Species with intermediate relative growth rates exhibited high biomass assimilation rates per unit leaf area. Species with low relative growth rates exhibited low leaf area ratios and low assimilation rates per unit leaf area.Relative growth rate was positively related to leaf carbon isotope discrimination, consistent with a trade-off between growth rate and water-use efficiency.Seasonal relative growth rate did not predict long-term demographic variance. However, leaf area plasticity in response to precipitation was positively related to long-term demographic variance. Our results illustrate how morphological and physiological traits influence demographic tracking of environmental variability and demonstrate how species differences in functional strategies determine population and community dynamics.;;;;;;;;;32;0;32;0;32;0022-0477;;WOS:000244114400012;

We analyzed 10-year data sets of mapped and measured saplings ( stems >= 150 cm in height and < 10 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) and trees ( stems >= 10 cm dbh) across 37.5 ha of permanent plots covering a 300-ha zone, within which seasonally flooded areas ( where the water table never descends below 1 m) have been mapped. Additionally, we tested the response of growth, survival, and leaf functional traits of these species to drought and flood stress in a controlled experiment. We tested for habitat preference using a modi. cation of the torus translation method. Strong contrasting associations of the species pairs of Iryanthera, Virola, and Symphonia were observed at the sapling stage, and these associations strengthened for the tree stage. Neither species of Eperua was significantly associated with flooded habitats at the sapling stage, but E. falcata was significantly and positively associated with flooded forests at the tree stage, and trees of E. grandiflora were found almost exclusively in nonflooded habitats. Differential performance provided limited explanatory support for the observed habitat associations, with only congeners of Iryanthera exhibiting divergent sapling survival and tree growth. Seedlings of species associated with flooded forest tended to have higher photosynthetic capacity than their congeners at field capacity. In addition, they tended to have the largest reductions in leaf gas exchange and growth rate in response to experimental drought stress and the least reductions in response to experimental inundation. The corroboration of habitat association with differences in functional traits and, to a lesser extent, measures of performance provides an explanation for the regional coexistence of these species pairs. We suggest that specialization to seasonally flooded habitats may explain patterns of adaptive radiation in many tropical tree genera and thereby provide a substantial contribution to regional tree diversity.;;;;;;;;;31;0;27;0;31;d_c-58;;WOS:000245668400021;17479765

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-301% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0266-4674;;WOS:000242132900005;

Compared to CO2, light and water treatment had greater effects on all morphological traits measured (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, biomass fractions). Cork oak showed particularly large increases in biomass in response to elevated CO2 under low-watered (W-) and high-illuminated conditions (L+). Allocation shifted from shoot to root under increasing irradiance (L+), but was not affected by CO2. Changes in allocation related to water limitation were only modest, and changed over time. Relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were significantly greatest in the L+/W+ treatment for both CO2 concentrations. Changes in RGR were mainly due to NAR. Growth responses to increased light, water or CO2 were strongest with light, medium with water availability and smallest for CO2, in terms of RGR. The rise in NAR for light and water treatments was counterbalanced by a decrease in SLA (specific leaf area) and LMF (leaf mass fraction). Results suggest that elevated CO2 caused cork oak seedlings to improve their performance in dry and high light environments to a greater extent than in well-irrigated and low light ones, thus ameliorating the effects of soil water stress and high light loads on growth.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0931-1890;;WOS:000242296600006;

Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate. suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components. interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments.

Invasive species had greater fecundity and vegetative reproduction than their noninvasive relatives. The invasive species also had higher relative growth rates, greater specific leaf area, and more plastic root-to-shoot ratios than noninvasive species.

Median fine-root life span, estimated using minirhizotron images of individual roots, ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 yr among species. Root life span was not correlated with leaf life span, but specific root length was significantly correlated with specific leaf area. Root nitrogen : carbon ratio was negatively correlated with root longevity, which corroborates previous research that has suggested a trade-off between organ life span and higher organ N concentrations. Specific traits such as thickened outer tangential walls of the exodermis were better predictors of long-lived roots than tissue density or specific root length, which have been correlated with life span in previous studies. Although theories linking organ structure and function suggest that similar root and leaf traits should be linked to life span and that root and leaf life span should be positively correlated, our results suggest that tissue structure and longevity aboveground (leaves) can contrast markedly with that belowground (roots).";;;;;;;;;141;16;134;0;162;d_c-15;;WOS:000239845400005;

Data were compiled consisting of 1240 observations (614 species) from 83 different experiments published in 37 different studies, in order to quantify the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR, g cm(-2) day(-1)), specific leaf area (SLA, cm(2) g(-1)) and leaf mass ratio (LMR, g g(-1)) in determining relative growth rate (RGR, g g(-1) day(-1)), and how these change with respect to daily quantum input (DQI, moles m(-2) day(-1)) and growth form (herbaceous or woody).2. Each of 1n(NAR), ln(SLA) and ln(LMR) were separately regressed on ln(RGR) using mixed model regressions in order to partition the between-experiment and within-experiment variation in slopes and intercepts. DQI and plant type were then added to these models to see if they could explain some of the between-experiment variation in the relative importance of each growth component.3. LMR was never strongly related to RGR. In general, NAR was the best general predictor of variation in RGR. However, for determining RGR the importance of NAR decreased, and the importance of SLA increased, with decreasing daily quantum input in experiments containing herbaceous species. This did not occur in experiments involving woody species.;;;;;;;;;74;1;69;2;77;0269-8463;;WOS:000238886100002;

Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species.Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical. disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth-survival trade-off, species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.";;;;;;;;;189;13;187;4;202;d_c-58;;WOS:000239457900012;16922323

However, there is controversy about the combined effects of these treatments on plant performance. We assessed the effects of two irradiances (full sunlight and moderate shade) and two summer watering regimes (high (daily) and low (alternate days)) on leaf and whole-plant traits of 1-year-old seedlings of Quercus coccifera, Q. ilex subsp. ballota and Q. faginea grown outdoors for 8.5 months. Leaf traits included measures of morphology, nitrogen concentration, gas exchange and photochemical efficiency, and measures of whole-plant traits included biomass allocation patterns, growth phenology, across-summer leaf area change and relative growth rate (RGR).Moderate shade reduced leaf mass per area, increased photochemical efficiency, maximum carbon assimilation rate (A(max)) and allocation to leaves, and prolonged the growing period in one or more of the species. Daily watering in summer increased A(max) of Q. ilex and prolonged the growing period of Q. ilex and Q. faginea. Both treatments tended to increase RGR. The effect of shade was greater in the low-watering regime than in the high-watering regime for two of the 15 studied traits, with treatment effects being independent for the remaining 13 traits. Leaf nitrogen and the ability to maintain leaf area after the arid period, rather than biomass allocation traits, explained the variation in seedling RGR. Trait responsiveness to the treatments was low and similar among species and between study scales, being unexpectedly low in Q. faginea leaves. This may be because selective pressures on leaf plasticity act differently in deciduous and evergreen species. We conclude that moderate shade and daily summer watering enhance the performance of Mediterranean Quercus seedlings through species-specific mechanisms.;;;;;;;;;24;0;24;0;25;0829-318X;;WOS:000235728100011;16356909

To achieve these objectives, 26 poplar F, hybrids and their parents were studied during their second growing season in central France. Tree growth (i.e., growth rates of stem height, circumference, and volume) was monitored during 1 month, and leaf traits (i.e., increases in number of leaves, maximum individual leaf area, specific leaf area, petiole length, and dry mass, leaf carbon and nitrogen contents, and internode length) were estimated at the end of the 1-month period. Growth traits were tightly correlated to most of the leaf traits. More precisely, it appeared that stem volume growth rate can be decomposed into two single leaf characteristics: maximum individual leaf area and leaf increment rate.

Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

Path analysis was conducted to explore the effects of light availability, basal height and size of individual branches on branch structure and growth.Branch angle was affected by basal height, whereas branch mass was influenced primarily by light availability. This result suggests that branch structure is strongly constrained by basal height, and that trees mediate such constraints under different light environments.Previous-year leaf area and light availability showed positive effects on current-year stem mass. In contrast, branch basal height and mass negatively affected current-year stem mass. Moreover, the length of stems of a given diameter decreased with increasing branch height. Therefore the cost of biomass investment for a unit growth in length is greater for branches of larger size and at upper positions.Vertical growth rate in length decreased with increasing height. Height-dependent changes in stem allometry and angle influenced the reduction in vertical growth rate to a similar degree.;;;;;;;;;9;3;11;0;13;0028-646X;;WOS:000241774900010;17096793

Although a higher growth rate would imply a higher sprouting vigour, fast-growing species may have less below-ground reserves, and thus, a lower sprouting potential. The relative importance of both opposite effects was little explored in the literature. To analyse the influence of growth rate on sprouting vigour, one growth season after a fire we measured plant height of the old (pre-fire) and new (post-fire) tissue in 194 individuals of 14 woody species from a woodland in central Argentina. We calculated a mean value of pre- and post-fire height for each species, and obtained from a database potential height at maturity, wood density (WD) and specific leaf area (SLA), as surrogates of intrinsic growth rate. We performed a forward stepwise multiple regression using WD and SLA, together with mean pre-fire height or potential height as independent variables, and mean post-fire height (as an indicator of resprout vigour) as the dependent variable. Interactions were also tested. Pre-fire height, WD and their interaction term were the variables that best explained post-fire height. We also analysed the relationship between pre- and post-fire size for each species independently by fitting hyperbolic functions. Then we correlated both parameters of the functions to species characteristics (WD, SLA, potential height and mean pre-fire height). Both parameters of the hyperbolic functions were significantly correlated only with WD, but not with the other species characteristics. All results together indicate that species with low WD (i.e. high potential growth rate) regrow more vigorously than species with high WD when pre-fire individuals were tall. In contrast, when pre-fire individuals were small, WD had no influence on sprout vigour. A trade-off between allocation of biomass to underground reserves and shoot growth seems to be responsible for the patterns obtained. For small individuals, below-ground reserves seem to play a more important role than inherent growth rate (here measured through WD) in determining the sprouting vigour, while for large individuals, growth rate seems more important than reserves.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;1442-9985;;WOS:000233411000006;

Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species.4 Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly.5 We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment.6 Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.;;;;;;;;;53;8;54;0;64;0022-0477;;WOS:000233287500012;

Some species of trees can grow more than 100 m in height and can live for several millennia, however whether these achievements are obtained at the cost of some other physiological functions is currently unclear. As increases in size are usually associated with ageing, it is also unclear whether observed reductions in growth rates and increased mortality rates are a function of size or of age per se. One theory proposes that reduced growth after the start of the reproductive phase is caused by cellular senescence. A second set of theories has focussed instead on plant size and the increased respiratory burdens or excessive height. We report on experimental manipulations to separate the effects of extrinsic factors such as size from those of intrinsic factors such as age for four tree species of contrasting phylogeny and life history. For each species, we measured growth, gas exchange and leaf biochemical properties for trees of different ages and sizes in the field and on propagated material obtained from the same genetic individuals but now all of small similar size in our common gardens. For all species, evidence indicated that size, not cellular senescence, accounted for the observed age-related declines in relative growth rates and net assimilation rates. Two species exhibited evidence of genetic control on leaf characters such as specific leaf area, although size also exerted an independent, and stronger, effect. We found partial support for the theory of hydraulic limitations to tree growth. The lack of a marked separation of soma and germline, an unlimited proliferation potential of meristem cells and the exponential increase in reproductive effort with size all help explain the lack of a senescence-induced decline in trees. It is possible that trees much older than the ones we sampled exhibit senescence symptoms.;;;;;;;;;123;6;120;0;130;1461-023X;;WOS:000232535300007;21352442

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs.

We evaluated the suitability of pot experiments for predicting field performance, measured as shoot biomass production, by investigating determinants of growth in hybrid willows (Salix spp.) grown under various environmental conditions in the field, and by comparing the data with the results from a corresponding pot Study. Biomass production in six hybrid willow clones, bred for use as bio-fuels, was assessed in three field trials located in central and southeastern Sweden throughout the first 3-year cutting cycle. The determinants of biomass productivity, measured as biomass allocation and nitrogen (N) economy, were identified in one of the field trials. Key traits for shoot biomass production in the field were total leaf area and total amount of N; plant N losses by shed leaves were only partly controlled by leaf-litter N concentration. These key traits were also obtained from the pot study and related to shoot biomass production and abscission-leaf N loss in the field. Total leaf area and total N pool of plants grown in pot experiments were good predictors of long-term biomass production in the field, whereas shoot biomass production, specific leaf area and tissue N concentration of pot-grown plants were less suitable as predictors of field performance. Relationships between the key traits and shoot biomass production were clone-specific, indicating the need for analysis of growth traits at the clone level if field performance of trees is to be evaluated based on data from pot studies.

Sun- establishing species had a higher proportion of leaf resistance in the xylem. Across species, component resistances correlated linearly with total leaf resistance.(.) K-leaf correlated tightly with indices of stomatal pore area, indicating a coordination of liquid- and vapor- phase conductances shifted relative to that of temperate woody species.(.)

Seedlings were grown outdoors during summer under two irrigation treatments: field capacity and 35% of field capacity. The relative growth rate (RGR) strongly depended on the growth form, from highest values in herbs to lowest in woody perennials. The main component associated with interspecific variation in RGR was the specific leaf area (SLA), and a quantitative grouping of the different growth forms appeared along the regression line between both parameters. The slow-growing species, i.e. woody perennial shrubs, had the lowest SLA and the fast-growing perennial herbs, the highest, while woody semi-deciduous shrubs appeared intermediate. Decreases in RGR due to water stress were analysed in terms of the relative contribution of the leaf mass ratio (LMR), SLA and the net assimilation rate (NAR). Pooling all species, the decrease in RGR caused by water deficit was mainly explained by decreases in SLA. However, this general pattern was strongly dependent of growth form. Thus, in the woody perennial plants, the decrease in RGR was accompanied by a three-fold decrease in NAR which, however, increased in perennial herbs. SLA increased with decreasing water supply in woody perennial plants, and decreased in woody semi-deciduous shrubs and perennial herbs. Finally, decreases in LMR partly explained decreases in RGR in perennial herbs and woody perennial shrubs. This different response of the different growth forms may reflect differences in seedling adaptation and surviving strategies to drought periods.;;;;;;;;;32;1;30;0;34;0029-8549;;WOS:000231779500003;15868165

All plants were growing in, or originated from, continental Mediterranean sites in central Spain. Seedlings tolerated moderate but not deep shade. Mortality was high and growth reduced in 1% sunlight. Survival was maximal in 12% sunlight and minimal in full sunlight, although the relative growth rate of the seedlings surviving in high light was similar to that of plants in moderate shade. Maximum photochemical efficiency at predawn was significantly lower in sun plants than in shade plants in the field, revealing chronic photoinhibition that was most pronounced in winter. Plasticity in response to available light varied according to the variable studied, being low for photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance, and high for specific leaf area root:shoot ratio and leaf area ratio, particularly in seedlings. Differences in water relations and hydraulic features between sun and shade plants in the field were marginal. High water potential at the turgor loss point of field-grown plants suggested that holly is sensitive to drought during both the seedling and the adult stage. Low relative growth rates in both high and low light with low physiological plasticity in response to light indicate the existence of a stress-tolerance mechanism. We conclude that holly is a facultative understory plant in areas of oceanic and relatively mild climate, but an obligate understory plant in dry continental areas such as the study site. The impact of abandonment of traditional management practices and climate change on these Mediterranean populations is discussed.;;;;;;;;;43;2;43;0;49;0829-318X;;WOS:000231208200009;15929935

Interspecific differences in RGR were strongly related to LMR (positive relationship, r(2)=0.50) and the rate of dry matter production per mol of leaf nitrogen (positive relationship, r(2)=0.64). Hence, the slow RGR of low-rainfall species was functionally related to a lower growth rate per mol of leaf nitrogen than high-rainfall species. Furthermore, slow RGR of low-rainfall species was related to greater allocation to roots at the expense of leaves. Increasing allocation to roots versus leaves is likely an adaptation to soil and atmospheric water deficits, but one that comes at the expense of a slow RGR.";;;;;;;;;11;0;10;0;11;0029-8549;;WOS:000231247800004;15891819

Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance.2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass.3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient.4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient.5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies.;;;;;;;;;85;1;79;1;86;0022-0477;;WOS:000229283000006;

RGR was greatest in the tree-fall gap in both species. Allocation to leaves was proportionally higher in the forest interior. SLA tended to be lower in the tree-fall gap, intermediate in the forest edge, and greater in the forest interior in both species. In addition, SLA of D. winteri seedlings was always greater than that of G. avellana in all three habitats.

Interspecific variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25-1180 mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2-5% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central Chile.2. As predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio (LAR) of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light LAR fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over approximate to500 mm tall.3. Although the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or Aristotelia.4. Above-ground relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to LAR, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings (>400 mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining LAR and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low light.5. Results are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.;;;;;;;;;61;2;60;5;69;0269-8463;;WOS:000225617200008;

Comparisons among closely related species should reveal adaptive differentiation in species characteristics that are consistent with their differences in geographic distribution. This expectation was tested by comparing characteristics of seedlings of spruce species in relation to environmental factors representative of their current natural ranges.Methods Seedlings were grown from a total of 34 Populations representing eight North American spruce (Picea) species in a controlled environment chamber for 140 d. Traits related to the potential of seedling establishment, including tolerance to stress events (high temperature, desiccation) were evaluated. Correlations were sought between these characteristics and modal values of latitude, aridity and continentality in the geographic range of each species.Key Results Many seedling traits changed significantly in response to stress events, but Only the response of chlorophyll concentration differed significantly among species. Components of seedling growth were good correlates of species distribution. Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with latitude, and leaf weight ratio (LWR) negatively correlated with aridity. Seed mass was negatively correlated with latitude.Conclusions Relationships found between seedling traits and geographical variation in environmental conditions suggest that factors such as temperature regime, water availability and perhaps litter depth affect species range in North American spruces. Seedling characteristics appear to be elements in a reasonably distinct environmental niche for each spruce species at the continental scale.

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

Clone CN5 possessed higher stomatal conductances at moderate stress as well as higher hydraulic conductances than Clone ST51.

Nitrogen-use efficiency (NUEN) is often decomposed into the product of N productivity (A(N)) and the mean residence time of N (MRTN). Theory suggests a trade-off between both components, but direct experimental evidence is still scarce. A field study with young trees of the evergreen Quercus ilex and the marcescent-evergreen Quercus faginea was carried out to test this trade-off through analysis of plant traits at organ, whole-plant and population levels.2. Specific leaf area (SLA) was the main trait positively related to A(N) in Q. faginea. By contrast, greater litter production and consumption by caterpillars resulted in larger N losses and shorter MRTN in Q. faginea. Early leaf senescence in Q. faginea produced leaf litter with high N concentration that contributed significantly to N loss. Moreover, Q. ilex had higher plant survivorship. The inverse relationship between leaf longevity and SLA is probably a key component of the trade-off between N losses and plant N productivity.3. Quercus faginea had greater N uptake from soil, linked to its longer specific root length of fine roots and greater biomass allocation to underground tissues. Smaller N losses in Q. ilex compensated for its smaller N uptake and allowed a similar N balance at whole-plant level.4. Our results support the hypothesis of a trade-off between A(N) and MRTN. Quercus ilex had a long MRTN, while Q. faginea has a high A(N), and vice versa. The long MRTN in Q. ilex involves not only reduced N loss through long intrinsic leaf life span, but also resistance to harsh environmental factors and defence against herbivores. This suggests that a long MRTN is a potentially successful strategy in nutrient-poor environments.;;;;;;;;;36;1;33;0;36;0269-8463;;WOS:000222821900004;

Phosphorus addition was used to test for effects due to P-limitation.3 Four species showed significantly higher growth on their natural soils, but one humult-soil species (D. aromatica) and the broadly distributed species were not significantly affected by soil type.4 One udult-soil species, D. lanceolata, had both lower relative growth rate and lower mycorrhizal colonization on humult soil. However, humult soils also had lower levels of Ca, Mg, K, N and probably water availability.5 The overall ranking of growth rates among species was similar on the two soils. Growth rates were strongly positively correlated with leaf area ratio and specific leaf area among species in both soils. With the exception of D. aromatica, species of the higher-nutrient soils had higher growth rates on both soils.6 Although P addition led to elevated soil-P concentrations, elevated root- and leaf-tissue P concentrations on both soils, there was no significant growth enhancement and therefore no evidence that P availability limits the growth or constrains the distribution of any of the six species in the field.

Seedlings from large (LS) and small (SS) seeds were grown at four soil moisture levels. Observations were made on height, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits such as relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Seeds of pioneer species and large seeds, within species, germinated earlier, and with increasing water stress, per cent germination and germination velocity declined. RGR was inversely related with drought tolerance. R:S ratio increased, RGR and SLA declined, but NAR increased with water stress. Notwithstanding successional status, the slow-growing species registered minimum reduction in biomass due to water stress. The response of LS and SS seedlings also differed for some of the growth variables. Increase in NAR could be a compensatory response to water stress, and the marked allocational plasticity could help maximize capture of the limited resource. Seedlings from smaller seeds, particularly of fast-growing species, would be able to cope with mild drought by morphogenetic and physiological plastic response in a better way than those from large seeds. However, seedlings from large seeds had greater survival than those from smaller seeds under intense water stress.;;;;;;;;;28;1;28;0;30;0266-4674;;WOS:000222985200004;

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Seedlings from large (LS) and small seeds ( SS) were grown at two CO2 levels ( ambient and elevated, 700 - 750 ppm). CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and foliar N were determined after 30 d exposure to elevated CO2. Seedlings were harvested after 30 d and 60 d exposure periods. Height, diameter, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits (RGR, NAR, SLA, R: S) were determined. Seedling biomass across species was positively related with seed mass. Within species, LS seedlings exhibited greater biomass than SS seedlings. Elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass for all the species. The relative growth rate ( RGR), net assimilation rate ( NAR), CO2 assimilation rate, R: S ratio and water use efficiency increased under elevated CO2. However, the positive impact of elevated CO2 was down regulated beyond 30 d exposure. Specific leaf area ( SLA), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance declined due to exposure to elevated CO2. Fast growing, early successional species exhibited greater RGR, NAR and CO2 assimilation rate. Per cent enhancement in such traits was greater for slow growing species. The responses of individual species did not follow functional types (viz. legumes, non-legumes). The enhancement in biomass and RGR was greater for large-seeded species and LS seedlings within species. This study revealed that elevated CO2 could cause large seeded, slow growing and late successional species to grow more vigorously.;;;;;;;;;12;0;10;0;13;0169-4286;;WOS:000184691000003;

To determine whether this clade has undergone a corresponding adaptive radiation in photosynthetic adaptations, we studied the natural light habitats and physiological characteristics of 11 species representing each sublineage. Across species in the field, average photon flux density (PFD) varies from 2.3 to 30.0 mol.m(-1).d(-1), and maximum assimilation rate (A(max)) ranges from 0.17 to 0.35 mumol CO2.g(--1).s(-1). Across species, A(max), dark respiration rate (R), Michaelis-Menten constant (k), light compensation point, specific leaf area (SLA), maximum carboxylation rate (V-emax), maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)), photosynthesis at saturating CO2 (A(sarCo2)), and carboxylation efficiency (a) all increase significantly and in tightly coupled fashion with PFD, in accord with classical economic theory. Area-based rates have a higher degree of physiological integration with each other and tighter coupling to PFD than the corresponding mass-based rates, despite the energetic importance of the latter. Area-based rates frequently show adaptive cross-over: high-light species outperform low-light species at high PFD and vice versa at low PFD. A(max)-mass has little relationship to leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf N content, or leaf lifespan individually, but a multiple regression explains 96% of the variance in A(max)-mass across species in terms of SLA, leaf N content, and average PFD. Instantaneous leaf compensation points range from 0.1 to 1.2% full sunlight, far lower than the ecological (whole-plant) compensation points (ECPs) of 1.1 to 29.0% sunlight calculated based on photosynthetic parameters, leaf longevity, and allocation to leaf vs. nonleaf tissue. The ECPs are much closer to the lower limits of PFD actually experienced by lobeliads, suggesting they may play an important role in restricting species distributions. Taken together, these data provide evidence for an adaptive radiation in photosynthetic traits that is strongly correlated with-and indeed may help determine-the light regime that each species inhabits.;;;;;;;;;77;7;75;0;88;f_vr-22;;WOS:000189147900008;21653379

The study comprised five dry tropical tree species: Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth, Acacia nilotica (L.) Delile, Phyllanthus emblica L., Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Beddome, and Terminalia chebula Retz. Of these, Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, and P. emblica are pioneer species. The former two are N-fixing legumes. Terminalia arjuna and T. chebula are nonpioneer, nonleguminous species. Albizia procera, P. emblica, and T. arjuna are fast growing, while the remaining two are slow-growing species. Seedlings of these species from large and small seeds were grown at four N input levels (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg N.ha(-1)). Height and leaf area were measured periodically. At the end of the experiment (after 4 months) biomass and other growth traits, namely relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and root/shoot ratio, were determined. Foliar N and net CO2 assimilation rates were also determined. The species responded differentially (66%-282% increase in biomass) to elevated N supply, but the response was not associated with between-species seed size variation. However, within species, small-seed seedlings exhibited a greater response. The elevated N input resulted in a greater enhancement in relative growth rate of the slow-growing species. The species response did not follow functional types such as pioneer versus nonpioneer, legumes versus nonlegumes, and deciduous versus evergreen, but rather was individualistic.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;ao_t-26;;WOS:000220266400002;

I compared photosynthetic physiology, growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of three shade-tolerant tree species, Virola koschynii Warb., Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record & Mell and Brosimum alicastrum Swartz., growing across a light gradient created by a forest-pasture edge (0.5 to 67% diffuse transmittance (%T)). Most growth and physiological traits showed nonlinear responses to light availability, with the greatest changes occurring between 0.5 and 20 %T. Specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen per unit leaf mass (N(mass)) decreased, maximum assimilation per unit leaf area (A(area)) and area-based leaf N concentration (N(area)) increased, and maximum assimilation per unit leaf mass (A(mass)) did not change with increasing irradiance. Plastic responses in SLA were important determinants of leaf N and A a across the gradient. Species differed in magnitude and plasticity of growth; B. alicastrum had the lowest relative growth rates (RGR) and low plasticity. Its final biomass varied only 10-fold across the light gradient. In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A(area) was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.";;;;;;;;;34;0;34;1;35;0829-318X;;WOS:000188786300003;14676032

Increase in diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured every 3 months for 2 years for 21 tree species from four habitats near Darwin: Eucalyptus open forest, mixed woodland, Melaleuca swamp and dry monsoon rainforest. Assimilation rates and foliar chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were positively correlated with growth rate and negatively correlated with leaf mass per area. For most species, increases in DBH were confined to the wet-season ( summer) period between November and May. Average annual increases in DBH were larger in the dry monsoon rainforest (0.87 cm) and the Melaleuca swamp (0.65 cm) than in the woodland (0.20 cm) and the open forest (0.16 cm), and were larger in non-Myrtaceous species (0.53 cm) than in Myrtaceous species (0.25 cm). These results are discussed in relation to the frequent fire regime prevailing over much of northern Australia which causes the marked contrast between the small pockets of fire-tender closed monsoon rainforest and the surrounding large expanses of fire-tolerant savanna.;;;;;;;;;51;1;48;1;53;0067-1924;;WOS:000221953200003;
SLA;B;Meyer, SR;;;;;;"Ward, JS; Twery, MJ";;Leaf area as a growth predictor for red spruce and balsam fir in managed stands in Maine;;;;;;;;FORESTRY ACROSS BORDERS;;;;;;;;44;44;;;;;2004;2004;"Forest stand structure is a function of many natural, ecological and anthropogenic processes. Currently, most growth models are empirically based on size attributes in stands. These model types are based on the assumption that wood growth is a function of the amount of wood present. Using leaf area as a determinant of density and structure applies physiological and ecological processes to stand growth. Models based on leaf area may reflect growth dynamics (i.e. differentiation) within the stand, while others assume all trees of similar sizes to have the same growth rate. The well-established leaf area-sapwood area (LA:SA) relationship may be used to estimate biologically-significant growth model parameters. The objectives of this study are 1) to validate the relationship between the leaf area and the sapwood. area for Abies balsamea (L.) Miller and Picea rubens (Sarg.) in Maine; 2) to quantify a growth modifier for individual trees; and 3) to better model the growth of managed stands based on crown dynamics.Data from destructive sampling during the summer of 2003 was used to estimate tree-level specific leaf area (SLA) based on the LA:SA relationship. This instance of SLA estimation is comparable to that of Gilmore et al. (1996) and to a crown length model (Valentine et al. 1994) to evaluate its effectiveness for estimating leaf area. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the model's performance across several variables, including site, age, and crown position. Inter-model comparisons were evaluated following the methods of Kenefic and Seymour (1999) and Gilmore et al. (1996).By using growth increment cores taken at all sites during the 2003 field season, this study attempted to reconstruct past leaf area based on constructed LA:SA equations. Stand growth was projected 5 years with Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS - Northeast variant - U.S. Forest Service, Growth Management Service Center) using the reconstructed growth data. FVS results were compared to the actual growth change observed from the radial increment record. Volume increment (VINC to projected leaf area relationships were compared across sites with ANOVA. Ratios of prior VINC to current VINC were compared to investigate its use as a growth potential modifier. Several parameters were tested in order to construct a growth potential modifier that most improves the FVS Northeast variant growth model performance.";;;;;84th Annual Winter Meeting of the New-England-Society-of-American-Foresters;MAR 23-26, 2004;"USDA Forest Serv, NE Res Stn; NE Forest Pest Council; NY Soc Amer Foresters; NE Forest Economists; Univ Laval";Quebec City, CANADA;0;0;0;0;0;;*************;WOS:000189483300019;

Baker) trees. Eucalyptus polybractea is a terpene-accumulating species, which stores terpenes in oil glands beneath the leaf surface. Using regression analysis, we showed that leaf thickness, measured as leaf mass per area (LMA), influenced terpene content, apparently through regulation of gland dimensions, and thus, gland volume. We also examined how environmental factors affected terpene content through regulation of both LMA, and therefore, storage capacity, and the supply of resources for terpene synthesis. Neither water stress, measured using carbon isotope ratios as an indicator, nor nutrient stress, measured as foliar nitrogen and phosphorus content, accounted for observed variation in either terpene content or LMA. Phenolic content, measured as a possible competing carbon sink, did not account for variation in terpene content, and variation in environmental stresses could not account for differences in growth rate. However, both terpenes and total carbon-based secondary metabolites (terpenes and phenolics) showed positive correlations with growth, suggesting plants gain a growth advantage by deploying greater amounts of secondary metabolites.;;;;;1st Meeting of Plant Ecophysiologists (ECOFIZZ);2003;;Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Melbourne, AUSTRALIA;23;1;19;1;24;1445-4408;;WOS:000221713600007;

We examined N allocation to Rubisco and chlorophyll, and photosynthetic characteristics in seedlings of nine Eucalyptus species grown in a fully sunlit glasshouse with an optimal supply of nutrients. Species were selected from mesic (1800 mm year(-1) rainfall) through to semi-arid habitats (300 mm year(-1)). All species were characterised by allocation of a large proportion of N to Rubisco (32 - 48%) with high in vivo specific activity. Intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) varied between 260 and 300 mumol mol(-1), and thus, stomatal limitations were low in all species. This combination of traits resulted in a PNUE(172 - 335 mumol mol(-1) s(-1)) that was higher than is commonly observed in tree species and which may be related to the rapid growth, water-spender strategy of Eucalyptus seedlings. There were significant differences in photosynthetic parameters and N allocation among species, but these were only weakly related to rainfall at the site of seed origin. There were correlations of Ci with PNUE but a sensitivity analysis suggested that interspecific variation in C-i explained at most 7% of variation in PNUE. Photosynthesis and PNUE were also rather insensitive to large interspecific differences in RuBP-limited rate of electron transport per unit N (J(max)/N), because photosynthesis was primarily limited by the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax). PNUE was most sensitive to changes in N allocation to Rubisco and V-cmax/Rubisco.;;;;;;;;;17;0;16;0;17;1445-4408;;WOS:000225573700004;

At a standardized leaf N, A(mass) was higher in angiosperms (56 nmol g(-1) s(-1)) than in conifers (36 nmol g(-1) s(-1)). Stepwize regression suggested that most of this difference in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency could be explained by G(s) and SLA. Mean G(s) (on an area basis) of angiosperms was higher than that of conifers (152 vs 117 mmol m(2) s(-1)), but A(area)-G(s) relationships were similar for the two groups. At a given leaf N, conifers had lower SLA (projected area basis) than angiosperms.Photosynthetic differences probably contribute to the competitive advantage of angiosperm trees over conifers in productive habitats, and may be linked to the greater hydraulic capacity of vessels, enabling angiosperms to develop higher stomatal conductance and therefore sustain higher transpiration rates.;;;;;;;;;41;1;45;0;46;0028-646X;;WOS:000186322000006;

The assumption that RGR is constant, has been the subject of debate for a long time. In this study, the changes in mean RGR (RGR) of 3 clones of Pinus radiata D. Don, grown under varying weed competition levels (complete weeding, weeding of 2 m diameter circles, weeding of I m diameter circles, and no weeding), were quantified for 3 consecutive years. RGR was calculated each winter, using the morphological and physiological characteristics of RGR change which quantified as follows:[GRAPHICS]where: LA=leaf area, Lw=leaf weight, W=dry weight of the plant, SLA=specific leaf area, i.e. the ratio of area and leaf weight, LWR=leaf weight ratio. i.e. the ratio of total leaf weight of the plant and the total dry weight of the plant, T=time (age), ULR=unit leaf rate. The results showed that the unweeded control treatment had the lowest absolute RGR. (RGR) over bar declined with time and tree size in all the weeded treatments, but increased in the control. The theory that (RGR) over bar is constant (RGR=k model) is shown to be false as it varies with both time and tree size. Changes in RGR during the period studied were best described by an exponential decay function: (RGR) over bar =a+b x exp(-cW). Clonal differences were also demonstrated: clone 3 showed a lower RGR than the other two clones. This was due to the increased LWR and LAR, leaf area ratio (SLA x LWR) of this clone. The main reason for mean RGR decline were: (1) reduced ULR with age and size of the plants, (2) changes in allometry and (3) physiological aging which ought have accentuated self shading effects. Tree size influenced RGR changes more than age. This study aims to dispel the notion or a constant RGR, and at the same time explains the reasons for the decline o this parameter in young trees.;;;;;4th International Conference on Forest Vegetation Management;JUN 17-21, 2002;;Nancy, FRANCE;5;0;6;1;6;1286-4560;;WOS:000220783000004;

Most predation occurs on young, expanding leaves. Thus, a rapid growth of the leaves can reduce the impact of predation. Furthermore, in cold Mediterranean climates the length of the growing season is constrained to a short period in spring and early summer owing both to low winter temperatures and drought stress in early summer. Therefore, a rapid deployment of leaf area and a high photosynthetic capacity during the spring and early summer might have important positive effects on the final carbon balance of the leaf population. Relative growth rates (RGR) of leaf biomass were measured in 19 woody species typical of Central Western Spain with deciduous and evergreen habits. Highly significant differences were detected in the leaf growth rate of the different species. The differences between species, however, did not correlate either with the mean leaf life-span of each of the species or with other leaf traits such as photosynthetic capacity, specific leaf area or nitrogen content. Leaf growth rate was positively correlated with time elapsed between leaf initiation and fruit maturation, so that species with fruit dispersal in spring and early summer in general had lower leaf growth rates than species with autumn fruit shedding. This relationship shows the effects of the concurrence between vegetative and reproductive organs for nutrients and other resources. Nitrogen concentration in the leaves was very high at the time of bud break, and declined during leaf expansion owing to the dilution associated with the increase in structural components. The rate of nitrogen dilution was, thus, positively related to the leaf growth rate. Relative growth rates calculated for nitrogen mass in leaves were very low compared to the growth in total mass. This suggests that most leaf nitrogen is translocated from the plant stores to the leaf biomass before the start of leaf expansion and that the contribution of root uptake during leaf expansion is comparatively low.;;;;;;;;;24;0;22;0;27;1385-0237;;WOS:000183836200011;

Stem diameter and plant height, measured over a 15-month period, were greatest in plants grown in full sunlight, and both parameters decreased with increasing shade. At 7 and 14 months after planting (MAP), total plant dry mass was highest in control plants and lowest in plants in 77% shade. Expansion of the fourth leaf whorl, monitored at 5-6 MAP, was slowest in plants in 77% shade and fastest in unshaded plants, which had more leaves and higher leaf areas and inter-whorl shoot lengths. In response to increasing shade, specific leaf area increased, whereas leaf weight ratio and relative growth rate decreased. Chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased with increasing shade, indicating shade-induced partitioning of chlorophyll into light-harvesting complexes. Compared to the response in unshaded plants, CO2 assimilation saturated at lower photosynthetic photon flux densities in plants in 77% shade, with a lower upper-asymptote to the light response curve. Chlorophyll fluorescence revealed no evidence of sustained photoinhibitory damage in unshaded plants. Dynamic photoinhibition decreased with increasing shade, with the greatest depression in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence around midday.

However, there were clear differences in allocation patterns and in phenotypic responses to light intensity. Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA).4 Savanna species also exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and net assimilation rate in response to light intensity. An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs. Many of these traits were correlated to seed mass, which is itself highly conserved within genera.;;;;;;;;;82;0;87;18;94;0022-0477;;WOS:000183144700014;

Shadehouse effects were investigated by examining the seedling growth and morphological properties of four shade-tolerant tree species from north-east Queensland in the forest and in neutral-density shadehouses for up to 1 y. Understorey plots were compared with 0.8% shadehouses, and single-treefall gaps were compared with 10% shadehouses. Seedlings of all species showed higher growth rates in the shadehouses compared with the equivalent forest treatments. Nonetheless, trends found between high- and low-light growth rates in the shadehouse seedlings were mirrored in forest-grown seedlings. Specific leaf area (SLA) values in the shadehouses provided a good approximation of SLA in the forest for species in both light treatments. In contrast, biomass allocation and leaf area ratios were only comparable for forest and shadehouse seedlings grown in the high-light treatment. Furthermore. seedlings grown in shadehouses differed significantly from forest-grown seedlings in terms of their root morphology. Despite the differences in absolute values of plant characters in the shadehouse and forest seedlings, 65% of significant differences detected between high- and low-light plant characters in shadehouse-grown seedlings were also found in the forest-grown plants.;;;;;;;;;13;8;14;1;25;0266-4674;;WOS:000182606600005;

Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N-2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competition - the CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.;;;;;;;;;241;5;217;2;262;0028-646X;;WOS:000180609700002;

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg. Screening of species for seed mass and SLA should help predict their germination and establishment success or failure in milled peatlands and allow more directed interventions to favour the establishment of desirable species in milled bogs.;;;;;;;;;15;4;17;0;22;1385-0237;;WOS:000186132100007;

Three separate experiments were conducted, involving 27 herbaceous species and 14 woody species aged 15-30 days, in order to determine the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in explaining interspecific variations in relative growth rate.2. Daily quantum inputs were 31.12 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the first experiment and 33.17 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the second and third experiments. This is about twice the typical irradiance of most other experiments in this area, but only about 85% of the daily photon flux in nature. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic sand culture in a solution containing 5.8 mm nitrogen.3. RGR was strongly and positively correlated with NAR in all three experiments. RGR was weakly and negatively correlated with SLA, while the correlation between RGR and LWR was weak and variable.4. These results are compared to those already published in the literature: the commonly reported result that interspecific variation in RGR is determined primarily by SLA is partly due to the low irradiance used in most experiments, and the relative importance of SLA and NAR changes depending on irradiance.5. A hypothesis is proposed in which direct and indirect effects of SLA on each of NAR and RGR are decomposed, and which leads to a trade-off between SLA and NAR as a function of daily irradiance.;;;;;;;;;84;9;81;1;97;0269-8463;;WOS:000178119300016;

These pen-nit the modelling of the time-course of growth and development of even-aged, intensively-managed, fertilised stands of Eucalyptus globulus. The parameters were determined by fitting output from 3-PG to observed stem biomass data (i.e. total above-ground woody biomass) and canopy leaf area index (LAI). To fit these data, it was necessary to modify 3-PG by making specific leaf area and the fraction of stem biomass in branch and bark explicitly age-dependent, and to include effects of temperature on canopy quantum efficiency. With these parameter values, 3-PG gave a good description of growth at seven of nine disparate sites in Tasmania and Western Australia. A partial explanation for its failure at one site in Western Australia is that this site was subject to a prolonged drought not reflected in the long-term mean climatic data used in this study. At the other, a high altitude site in Tasmania, 3-PG predicted significant growth although extensive frost damage had prevented establishment of a viable canopy. The model was also applied to non-fertilised stands in northern Tasmania for which only basic growth and site data were available. 3-PG adequately predicted the observed peak MAI of the better sites, but over-estimated peak MAI at poor or high-altitude sites.The following conclusions are drawn: 3-PG can provide a good simulation of future growth of intensively-managed, fertilised stands of E. globulus if the model is initialised with observed biomass data at some age around or following canopy closure. If the model is initialised with typical seedling biomass at planting, 3-PG adequately predicts stem growth rate but not canopy LAI. Further development of 3-PG should take into account possible environmental effects on litterfall, the effects of partial canopy closure during early canopy development, and the prediction of mortality prior to the onset of self-thinning.

We examined the combined effects of elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and defoliation on growth and physiology of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Seedlings were planted in the ground in eight open-top chambers. Four chambers were ventilated with CO2-enriched air (ambient + 283 mumol mol(-1)) and four chambers were supplied with ambient air. After 6 weeks of growth, half of the leaf area was removed on a subset of seedlings of each species in each CO2 treatment. We monitored subsequent biomass gain and allocation, along with leaf gas exchange and chemistry. Defoliation did not significantly affect final seedling biomass in either species or CO2 treatment. Growth recovery following defoliation was associated with increased allocation to leaf mass in maple and a slight enhancement of mean photosynthesis in aspen. Elevated [CO2] did not significantly affect aspen growth, and the observed stimulation of maple growth was significant only in mid-season. Correspondingly, simulated responses of whole-tree photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] were constrained by a decrease in photosynthetic capacity in maple, and were partially offset by reductions in specific leaf area and biomass allocation to foliage in aspen. There was a significant interaction between [CO2] and defoliation on only a few of the measured traits. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that atmospheric CO2 enrichment will substantially alter tree responses to folivory. However, our findings do provide further indication that regeneration-stage growth rates of certain temperate tree species may respond only moderately to a near doubling of atmospheric [CO2].;;;;;;;;;13;0;12;0;13;0829-318X;;WOS:000175714000001;11986047

High RGR, small seed masses, and short generation times characterize pine species that are successful invaders in disturbed habitats. Discriminant analysis and logistic regression revealed that RGR was the most significant factor among these life-history traits separating invasive and noninvasive species. We also explored the causes of differences in RGR among invasive and noninvasive species. While net assimilation rate, leaf mass ratio, and specific leaf area (SLA) were all found to be contributing positively to RGR, SLA was found to be the main component responsible for differences in RGR between invasive and noninvasive pines. We investigated differences in SLA further by studying leaf anatomy, leaf density, and leaf thickness. We also evaluated relative leaf production rate as an important aspect of SLA.

Previous studies on the combined effects of light and nutrient supply on the growth rates of plants have involved adding nutrients to soils to levels rarely (or never) met by the plants in nature. As a better test of the likely response of plants to root competition for nutrients. we grew for 1 year seedlings of six species of Australian rainforest tree on forest topsoil undiluted and on soil diluted 50/50, 25/75 and 5/95 with coarse sand. Seedlings were grown in tall tubes in 6 and 9% daylight, equivalent to gap-edge and gap-centre conditions.2. The six species varied in their light requirements for establishment and onward growth.3. One species grew significantly and markedly more quickly on soil diluted 50/50 with sand (Elaeocarpus grandis). Improved aeration is the most likely explanation.4. The extent of inhibition by soil dilution correlated positively with the absolute amount of new dry mass accreted in one year, whether the larger accretion resulted from a combination of high relative growth rate (RGR) and small embryo size, or moderate RGR and larger embryo size.5. Soil dilution generally reduced leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio, but had no significant effect on specific leaf area.6. In all species the overall concentration of nitrogen in the whole plant declined with soil dilution, in the four species tested, N concentration in leaves declined, and it is likely that the reduction in growth arose partly from a reduced unit leaf rate. Most species showed increases in the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg with soil dilution, or no change, but in Diploglottis bracteata the concentrations of Ca and Mg, especially in the older leaves, declined markedly with soil dilution, and one of these cations could have been limiting growth.7. Extrapolation of the results to the field suggests that in single-treefall gaps the fastest growing species will the most inhibited by root competition.8. The soil-dilution technique is likely to be more appropriate than nutrient addition as an indicator of sensitivity to root competition on a given soil.;;;;;;;;;8;0;8;0;9;0269-8463;;WOS:000175467600009;

For economically important species like the ornamental plant Ficus benjamina (Moraceae) it would be advantageous if such a limitation could be partly overcome in order to reduce growing periods. To identify the physiological causes for the low relative growth rate of this species, we compared it with three species of taxonomically related families: Musanga cecropioides (Moraceae), a fast-growing tropical pioneer tree; Cannabis sativa (Cannabaceae), a ruderal herb; and Pilea nummularifolia (Urticaceae), a tropical forest understorey herb. Relative growth rate at similar plant size was about half for F benjamina (65 mg(-1) day(-1)) as compared to the other tree species and the two herbaceous species (113-137 mg(-1) day(-1)), due mainly to differences in leaf area ratio (LAR; 15.9 vs. 25.9-34.1 m(2) kg(-1)). Net assimilation rates were neither different, nor were measured rates of leaf photosynthesis, The differences in LAR were brought about by differences in leaf morphology/anatomy rather than differences in biomass allocation to leaves: specific leaf area (SLA) of F. benjamina was much lower (28.9 vs. 46.6-52.7 m(2) kg(-1)), whereas leaf mass ratio (LMR) was not. Both leaf thickness and dry matter fraction varied among species, but E benjamina was the only species with high values for both variables, and hence had the lowest SLA. The two trees did not show higher investment in woody stems. We conclude that at similar size woody plants do not necessarily have lower growth rates than herbaceous plants. SLA is a key trait determining growth rate, Selection for higher SLA may enhance productivity, but caution is warranted due to likely reductions in leaf life-span and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress.

We studied their growth and photosynthetic performances in contrasting light environments, in order to assess the potential of these seedlings for future silvicultural use as well as to characterize their optimal light requirements. Seedlings were grown for 3.5 months in a greenhouse under three light intensities, full light (100%), partial shade (15%), and full shade (2.5%). Survival, growth, biomass allocation, leaf turnover and plant morphology were determined for all seedlings and gas exchange measurements were measured on a sub-sample of each species. Results showed that Pollalesta discolor had a high growth rate, a rapid leaf turnover, a large total leaf area and a high specific leaf area (SLA), coupled with high photosynthetic rates, when grown in a full-light environment. These traits confirm that it is shade intolerant, requiring a high-light environment for establishment as a seedling, characteristic of an early-successional species. Inga densiflora appeared to require some shade during its seedling stage, as shown by highest photosynthetic rates in partial shade. The full light treatment caused photoinhibition, impairing photosynthetic rates, and the full shade treatment was linked to high mortality, indicating that this species could not persist in a forest understory. Platymiscium pinnatum thrived equally well under both shade treatments, and had lower photosynthetic rates under the full light treatment. It was definitely a shade-tolerant species, displaying characteristics of a late-successional species. Increased growth performances with increased light intensity would indicate that this species could eventually benefit from higher light conditions. This experimental characterization of light requirements for seedlings of lesser known native species, through growth and photosynthetic performances under contrasting light environments, provided valuable information on their early establishment requirements, which could be used in selecting the proper light regime in nurseries and plantation models.;;;;;;;;;13;0;11;0;13;1439-1791;;WOS:000177365000002;

Doubled CO2 promoted tree growth, indicated by more leaves and shoots, a larger average leaf area, and total leaf dry weight per tree, as well as a wider canopy and trunk diameter. Average shoot length and diameter, shoot length per tree, tree height, and total leaf area increased, whereas specific leaf area and leaf area ratio of the trees decreased at 700 ppm CO2 When compared to trees grown under 350 ppm CO2, 700 ppm CO2-treated trees stimulated the mean daily growth rate of total leaf area by 73-130%, total shoot length by 161-162%, and plant dry mass by 134-158%, respectively. Impacts of long-term atmospheric CO2 enrichment on dry weight ratio in different components of the trees were more prominent in above-ground organs than in roots. High CO2 raised leaf and shoot dry weight ratio, but reduced stem dry weight ratio, whereas root dry weight ratio and root/shoot ratio of the trees were not affected throughout the experiment.

The physiological and morphological mechanisms for the increased apple tree growth and plant development by the doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration were associated with net assimilation rate and relative growth rate of the plants as well as cell differentiation and elongation of the plant organs. The adjustment of plant growth under long-term atmospheric CO2 enrichment resulted from the plant adaptation to high CO2 conditions, which was affected by carbon sink/ source availability and strength.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0016-478X;;WOS:000174243800002;

The main objective of this study was to test the association between leaf turnover rate and RGR, specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry weight) and other growth variables. Plants were grown for 6 months in a greenhouse under favourable water and nutrient conditions. Variation in RGR among the 16 woody species was due mainly to differences in morphological parameters such as leaf area ratio (LAR, whole plant area/whole plant dry weight) and SLA). However, temporal variation in RGR within species was due mainly to variation in net assimilation rate. When phylogeny was not taken into account. analyses showed that deciduous species grew faster than evergreens. In contrast, when phylogeny was taken into account. the data analysis showed that a faster RGR is not consistently associated with the deciduous habit (in five pairs it was, but in the other three it was not). The faster growth of the deciduous trees (in the five positive contrasts) could be explained by their higher LAR and higher SLA relative to evergreens. The lack of differences in RGR between deciduous and evergreens (in three pairs) was due to the higher leaf mass ratio (LMR, leaf dry biomass/total dry biomass) for the evergreens. which offset the higher SLA of the deciduous species, resulting in a similar LAR in both functional groups (LAR=LMRxSLA).

In contrast to studies with herbaceous species at lower light, net assimilation rate (NAR) contributed more than leaf area ratio (LAR) or specific leaf area (SLA) to interspecific variation in RGR. This was associated with a larger interspecific variation in NAR than found in experiments with lower light. Without the two most shade-tolerant species, however, the contribution of LAR and its components to interspecific variation in RGR was similar or even higher than that of NAR. Leaf dry matter content correlated negatively with RGR and was the only component of LAR contributing in a similar manner to variation in LAIR and RGR. There was a positive correlation between NAR and biomass allocation to roots, which may be a result of nutrient-limited growth. RGR correlated negatively with biomass allocation to leaves. Leaf thickness did not correlate with RGR, as the positive effect of thin leaves was counterbalanced by their lower NAR. Low inherent RGR was associated with species from nutrient-poor or shady habitats. Different components constrained growth for these two groups of species, those from nutrient-poor habitats having high leaf dry matter content, while those from shady habitats had thin leaves with low NAR.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;1435-8603;;WOS:000170738300017;

However, this basis is fundamental to predicting species' responses to rising atmospheric CO, in the forest understorey. We linked a leaf photosynthesis and a tree architecture model to predict the effects of dynamic and steady state photosynthetic characteristics, crown architecture and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration( [CO2]) on crown-level carbon gain (A(crown)). Twenty-four-h A(crown) was modelled for shade-tolerant Acer rubrum and shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera saplings growing for three years in a forest understorey under ambient and elevated [CO2] in free-air CO2 enrichment.2, Two factors best explained A(crown) in ambient [CO2]: tree light environment and sapling allometry. Microsite light environment influenced carbon gain via daily photosynthetic photon flux (PFD), average diffuse PFD and sunfleck characteristics. Species differences in specific leaf area (SLA) and size-related biomass allocation to leaves affected the effective leaf area and hence A(crown).3, At a common above-ground biomass, small saplings (100 g above-ground dry mass) of L. tulipifera had higher A(crown) than A. rubrum samples due to larger SLA and greater biomass allocation to leaves. Larger saplings of the two species had similar A(crown) due to greater carbon allocation to leaves with increasing plant size in A. rubrum vs L. tulipifera. For saplings > 800 g, A(crown) was greater in A. rubrum than in L. tulipifera. Enhancement of A(crown) by elevated [CO2] on sunny days was similar for both species.4, Overall, though the shade-tolerant species had lower A(crown) than the shade-intolerant species at a common small size, our results indicate that the relative performance of these species can reverse at larger sizes due to allocational differences. These results suggest that elevated [CO2] may accelerate competition for light between A. rubrum and L, tulipifera as these species grow larger in the understorey.;;;;;;;;;25;1;21;0;26;0269-8463;;WOS:000168273700013;

The objective of the study was to assess the potential of the species for growth under forest canopies and to identify their habitat preferences. The light regimes were created using shade cloth and the) corresponded with deep forest understoreys (2% of the light in the open gap); moderate shade (10%), slight shade as is found in edges of forest gaps (20%) and 100% representing open gaps. Seedling biomass was significantly influenced by light regimes for all species as were total leaf area and relative growth rate. H. abyssinica had the highest growth rate but the lowest survival rate in shade. There was a consistent trend for higher specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) at lower growth light regimes in O. europea and P. falcatus. O. europea and P. falcatus had similar allocation patterns whereby between 20-40% of the total biomass uas allocated to stem, 20-30% to roots and 50-60% to leaves. In H. abyssinica up to 80% was allocated to leaves and only a small percentage to stem and to roots.Within species there were significant differences in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area among the plants grown at the lowest light level and in the open. For plants grown in the open there were ver): little among species differences in A,,,, per unit area. However, there were significant differences in the ii,,, of the different species grown at the lowest light level. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements indicated that open-grown P. falcatus and O. europea experienced moderate photoinhibition. From the growth and photosynthesis results P. falcatus and O. europea appeared to be non-pioneer, shade-tolerant species, while J. procera and to a larger extent H. abyssinica showed pioneer, light-demanding characteristics.

The consistency of relationships between RGR and its component attributes leaf nitrogen productivity (LNP), leaf N per area (LNCa), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) was assessed across 12 datasets comprising three growth forms (grasses, herbaceous dicots and woody plants; 250 species in total). These relationships were characterised in terms of scaling slopes (regressions on log-log axes, the slopes giving the proportional relationship between the variables). Mathematically, the expected scaling slope between RGR and each component is 1.0, giving an appropriate null hypothesis to test against (whereas the widely used null hypothesis of zero correlation is in fact inappropriate for this situation). Deviations below 1:1 scaling slopes indicate negative covariance between the components. Consequently, the correlation structure between the components of RGR should also be investigated. Biologically, RGR should scale 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa and somewhat more weakly with LNCa at a given SLA. SLA and LNCa should themselves scale with a slope of between 0 and -1, with the actual slope indicating the extent to which between-species variation in SLA dilutes leaf N on an area basis versus the ability of species to maintain LNCa at a given growth irradiance. On average, across the 12 datasets RGR scaled close-to-proportionally with SLA, and 1:1 with SLA at a given LNCa. RGR scaled with LNCa with null or negative slopes, since SLA and LNCa scaled negatively (with slopes generally shallower than -1); however, RGR scaled positively (but less than proportionally) with LNCa at a given SLA. For these key relationships there were no qualitatively different conclusions with respect to the growth form under consideration or the growth irradiance at which the seedlings were grown. RGR also scaled close-to-proportionally with LNP, while LNP and LNCa were negatively associated. These relationships involving LNP are difficult to interpret since it can be shown that they are, at least potentially, the result of the interactions between RGR, SLA and LNCa, as well as reflecting intrinsic differences in the efficiency of nitrogen use in the growth process.";;;;;;;;;51;3;49;3;56;0029-8549;;WOS:000167629200003;

To evaluate effects of LMA and leaf anatomy on CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), we measured LMA, leaf thickness, the thickness of mesophyll components, and gas exchange rates at ambient CO2 concentration in leaves of six woody deciduous and evergreen species with different leaf life spans. In two species, CO2 assimilation was also estimated at saturating CO2 concentrations.There were interspecific differences in all morphological variables studied. Long-lived leaves had higher LMA and were thicker than short-lived leaves. Species with high LMA had low assimilation rates and NUE, both in ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations. Thus, in species with high LMA, assimilation was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, possibly because of a lower allocation of N to the photosynthetic machinery than in species with low LMA. Within a species, thicker leaves tended to have a lower tissue density. In intraspecific comparisons under field conditions, increasing internal air volume had positive effects on WUE, probably because of enhanced internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation. We conclude that, in interspecific comparisons, different patterns of N partitioning strongly influence NUE, whereas in intraspecific comparisons, internal leaf anatomy is a key factor regulating resource-use efficiency.;;;;;;;;;59;2;53;3;62;0829-318X;;WOS:000167266700006;11276419

Sapling growth of six rain forest tree species was compared to evaluate whether species respond in a similar way to a natural light gradient. Saplings were measured non-destructively; production and loss of leaves, stem and branches were analysed in detail.2. Sapling height growth was positively related to light environment and leaf area. No single descriptor of light environment explained sapling growth best. Direct or diffuse Light could explain plant growth, depending on species.3, Seventeen percent of the saplings had negative relative biomass growth rates, although they occurred in fairly bright conditions. Negative growth rates were caused by leaf shedding and stem breakage. Sapling relative growth rate increased with irradiance, mainly because of an increase in net assimilation rate.4. On a shoot basis, shaded plants had a smaller leaf mass fraction (LMF) and a larger specific leaf area, resulting in similar leaf area ratios (LAR) to those of sun plants. This contrasts with the results of seedling studies under controlled conditions, where LMF and LAR increased with shade.5. Biomass partitioning to leaf growth decreased with irradiance and relative growth rate of the sapling. This leaf partitioning ratio was better correlated with RGR than with irradiance.6. Species differed in the effect of light-dependent changes in specific leaf area (SLA) on growth. This underscores the importance of SLA in explaining differences in species performance in a forest environment.

Field measurements of growth rates, fertile frond production and leaf traits were made monthly over the course of one gear. Sphaeropteris cooped had a significantly higher growth rate, both in terms of height increase and frond production, and maintained four times more fronds than the native Cibotium species. The mean annual height increase of the invasive tree fern was 15 cm compared to 2 to 3 cm for the native tree ferns. The leaf mass per area of S. cooperi was significantly lower than that of the native Cibotium species, and the leaf life span was significantly shorter, suggesting that the cost of construction of the invasive species' fronds was relatively low.

Shading for 60 days had no effect on survival, but it influenced all growth parameters measured. Total biomass decreased with decreasing irradiance, reflecting reductions in dry mass of leaves, stems and roots. In response to shading, allocation of biomass to leaves increased, while allocation of biomass to roots decreased. Specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio increased with decreasing irradiance. Decreases in relative growth rate were caused by reductions in net assimilation rate rather than leaf area ratio. Photosynthetic efficiency, as determined by the F-v/F-m ratio (F-v = variable fluorescence, F-m = maximal fluorescence), was unaffected by the shading treatments. Partial removal of leaves, stem or roots did not affect seedling survival. Seedlings responded to removal of plant parts by compensatory growth.

The growth response of seedlings of A. procera from seeds of different sizes was studied under four soil water levels. Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated and grown in a glasshouse for 3 weeks under optimal water supply, and were subsequently maintained at four soil water levels for 4 months. Soil matric potentials for 1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 water holding capacity (WHC) were -0.01, -0.1, -0.61 and -1.20 MPa. respectively. Plant height, stem diameter and leaf area were measured fortnightly. Seedlings were harvested at the end of the experiment. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), stem weight ratio (SWR), root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were determined. Seedlings from large seeds had a higher biomass and leaf area and were more tolerant of long-term extreme water stress compared to those from small seeds which were more tolerant of moderate levels of water stress. Seedlings from small seeds did not survive beyond 75 d at 1/4 WHC. Increase in the R:S ratio along with a decrease in SWR reflected a shift in biomass allocation from above- to below-ground parts as soil water level decreased. SLA declined sharply with increasing water stress, which in turn led to a decrease in RGR. NAR increased with water stress. The study revealed the ability of the species to acclimate to a wide range of moisture stress by morphogenetic (increased R:S ratio and decreased SWR) and physiological (increased NAR) plastic responses.

The leaf traits analysed included density, thickness, saturated mass/dry mass, and leaf nitrogen per mass and per area. Other traits described the anatomy of leaves, most of them relating: to the lamina (proportions of palisade and spongy parenchymata, epidermis, air space and sclerified tissues, expressed as volume per leaf area, and per-cell transversal areas of epidermis and parenchymata), and another referring to the mid rib (transversal section of sclerified tissues). Across the whole set of species leaf mass per area was correlated with leaf density but not with thickness. and this was confirmed by taxonomic relatedness tests. Denser leaves corresponded with greater proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, smaller cells and lower water and N contents, but no relation was found with the proportion of air space in the lamina. Taxonomic relatedness analysis statistically supported the negative association of leaf density with saturated to dry leaf mass ratio. Thicker leaves also exhibited greater volume per leaf area and greater individual cell area in each of the tissues, particularly parenchyma. Mean leaf mass per area and leaf thickness were lower in deciduous than in evergreen species, but no significant differences in leaf density, proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina or cell area were found between the two groups. Leaf mass per area was higher in trees and subshrubs than in shrubs and climbers-plus-scramblers, this rank being equal for leaf density and proportion of sclerified tissues in the lamina, and reversed for cell area. Given the standardised environment and ontogenetic phase of the seedlings, we conclude that variation in leaf structure and anatomy among species and species groups has a strong genetic basis, and is already expressed early in the development of woody plants. From an ecological viewpoint, we can interpret greater leaf mass per area across this species set as greater allocation to support and defence functions, as shown predominantly by species from resource-poor environments.;;;;;;;;;99;25;93;4;128;0029-8549;;WOS:000089509700002;

We tested the hypothesis that a species with short-lived foliage, Pinus radiata D. Don (mean leaf lifespan 2.5 years), grows faster than P. pinaster Ait., a species with more persistent foliage (leaf lifespan 5.6 years), and that the faster growth rate of P. radiata is associated with a greater allocation of nitrogen and carbon to photosynthetic tissues across a range of scales. In fully sunlit foliage, the proportion of leaf N in the major photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase) was greater in P. radiata than in P. pinaster, and, in mid-canopy foliage, the proportion of leaf N in thylakoid proteins was greater in P. radiata. A lesser proportion of needle cross-sectional area was occupied by structural tissue in P. radiata compared to P. pinaster. Foliage mass in stands of P. radiata was 9.7 t ha(-1) compared with 18.2 t ha(-1) in P. pinaster while leaf area index of both species was similar at 4.6 m(2) m(-2), owing to the compensating effect of differences in specific leaf area. Hence trade-offs between persistence and productivity were apparent as interspecific differences in patterns of whole-tree carbon allocation, needle morphology, anatomy and biochemistry. However, these interspecific differences did not translate into differences at the stand scale since rates of biomass accumulation were similar in both species (P. radiata 6.9+/-0.9 kg year(-1) tree(-1); P. pinaster 7.4+/-0.9 kg year(-1) tree(-1)).

The seedlings were grown in closed-top chambers at four temperature regimes (-2.9 degrees C below ambient, ambient, + 2.3 degrees C and + 4.8 degrees C above ambient) in combination with two CO2 partial pressures (40 Pa and 74 Pa). Growth was followed by making destructive harvests c. every 25 d from germination in early June to senescence in late September. Allocation patterns were significantly affected by the temperature regimes. However, changes in dry matter allocation and morphology associated with the different treatments at a given time were mostly a result of differences in tree size. Temperature regimes only had a significant effect on the relative growth rate, RGR, at the beginning of the experiment. In contrast to temperature, high [CO2] increased RGR throughout the experiment when compared with plants of equal size. As the trees increased in size net assimilation rate, NAR, decreased but the effect of [CO2] on both NAR and RGR had a tendency to increase. Increases in NAR caused by elevated [CO2] were partly counteracted by reductions in the leaf area ratio, NAR. Reductions in LAR were caused by concomitant reductions in specific leaf area, SLA, whereas the level of [CO2] did not significantly affect leaf weight ratio, LWR, nor other dry weight ratios. The interactions between temperature and [CO2] are highly dependent on whether they are expressed as instantaneous values for plants at a common age or instantaneous values at a common size (and thereby extracting the effects of ontogenetic drift). When comparing instantaneous values at common sizes, the positive effect of [CO2] on RGR increased with plant size in every temperature regime. This also occurred in every temperature regime when comparing plants of equal age but the response to [CO2] was less. The effect of [CO2] on RGR was dependent on growth temperature. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on RGR were less than the positive effect on photosynthesis. The two provenances did not differ significantly in the response of RGR to [CO2] which is in agreement with measurements of photosynthesis.;;;;;;;;;26;0;24;0;26;0028-646X;;WOS:000088299900007;

Expanding leaves maintained high rates of A(area) but due to high growth respiration rates, net CO2 fixation occurred only at irradiances >200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). We found that full structural leaf development is not a necessary prerequisite for maintaining positive CO2 balance in young birch leaves. Maximum rates of A(area) were realized in late June and early July, whereas the highest values of A(mass) occurred in May and steadily declined thereafter. The maintenance respiration rate averaged approximate to 8 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1), whereas growth respiration varied between 0 and 65 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). After reaching its lowest point in mid-June, leaf respiration increased gradually until the end of the growing season.

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, SLA), net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, NARa) and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, LMR). Commonly, most cross-species variation in RGR is accounted for by variation in SLA, while no general relationships occur between RGR and either NARa or LMR. NARa can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, LNP) and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, LNCa). In this way the influence on RGR of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated.2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in SLA, LNP, LNCa and LMR explained c. 44%, 22%, 19% and 15% of variation in RGR, respectively. SLA and LNP were positively associated with RGR, while LNCa was negatively associated with RGR. LNP and LNCa were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between RGR and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between RGR and NARa. It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between NARa and RGR.3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' (NAR) and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, NUR). At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low RGR tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be co-ordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with RGR across all species.;;;;;;;;;47;21;49;2;71;0269-8463;;WOS:000086232500013;

To understand life history traits of four successful invasive Melastomataceae, two shade-intolerant herbs (Arthrostema ciliatum and Tibouchina herbacea) and two shade-tolerant woody species (Clidemia hirta, a shrub, and Miconia calvescens, a tree) were subjected to three light levels and two watering regimes in a greenhouse. Plant height, leaf number and area, biomass allocation, relative growth rate (RGR), carbon assimilation (A), leaf nutrient content, leaf construction costs (CC), specific leaf mass (SLM), and leaf spectral properties were determined at the end of the experimental period. Plant size, total biomass, RGR, A, CC, and SLM decreased, whereas leaf light transmittance and leaf N increased under low light in all species. The effects of water stress were weaker than light-stress effects. Relative growth rate of herbs grown in sun and partial shade (0.046 and 0.033 g g(-1) d(-1), respectively) was higher than in the woody species (0.027 and 0.020 g g(-1) d(-1)). Woody species allocated more biomass to leaf production than herbs, which allocated more biomass to stem production. Shade increased allocation of biomass to leaves, and water stress increased the root-shoot ratio in all species. Partial shade increased leaf area ratios more in the herbs (140%) than in woody species (68%). Miconia calvescens and C. hirta had higher leaf absorbance (92%) than both herbs (79%). Maximum A under all light treatments was similar in all species, and there was substantial acclimation to the different light levels. Leaf construction cost was higher-in the apparently long-lived leaves of the woody species. Relative growth rate, carbon allocation, and SLM showed larger changes to light and water stress than A and related photosynthetic parameters. All species showed responses qualitatively similar to those of other tropical species including the high acclimation potential to light, but the herbs exhibited the largest quantitative responses. When compared with a large group of native species, the four melastomes appear to be better suited to capture and use light, which is consistent with their rapid spread in mesic and disturbed Hawaiian environments.;;;;;;;;;42;3;43;1;48;1058-5893;;WOS:000085679000011;
SLA;J;King, DA;;;;;;;;Juvenile foliage and the scaling of tree proportions, with emphasis on Eucalyptus;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;80;6;;;1944;1954;;10.2307/176670;;;sept-99;1999;Juvenile foliage on seedlings and saplings occurs across a wide range of tree species and is particularly notable among eucalypts. Juvenile leaves generally have a lower leaf mass per area (LMA) and are often more horizontal in orientation than adult leaves. This paper examines the hypothesis that the shift from juvenile to adult foliage is related to the scaling of mechanical support costs.A simple model of stem allometry and production was used to show that low values of LMA and leaf area per unit crown area (LAI) should increase the growth rates of small, open-grown seedlings, but not larger saplings or trees. This result occurs because relatively little biomass need be invested in stems and branches to spread out the leaf mass of a seedling, favoring the option of increasing light interception by increasing crown area. In contrast, the large support requirements of trees make increasing crown area expensive and favor shifts to higher LAI and LMA, thereby increasing within-crown light interception and light use efficiency. Reported LMA values for juveniles are lower than for older trees under similar light levels, and there is evidence for similar trends in LAI. However, juvenile foliage may have a variety of other functions, including the enhancement of shade tolerance, and trade-offs may also occur between efficient light interception and protection against herbivores and mechanical damage. Model simulations suggest that the nature and duration of the juvenile phase can have large impacts on early growth, particularly in favorable environments.;;;;;;;;;26;0;25;0;26;d_c-58;;WOS:000082408300013;

We tested this model by quantitatively reviewing growth, leaf lifespan, CO2 exchange and morphological data from 76 studies on woody seedlings grown under conditions of low light. Data were placed into three tolerance categories (intolerant, intermediate, tolerant), two light categories (less than 4% and 4-12%) and two leaf phenology categories (broad-leaved evergreen and winter deciduous). For both evergreen and deciduous groups, intolerant species had traits conferring greater growth potential than tolerant species in both light categories. These traits included greater leaf mass ratio, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and mass-based photosynthetic rates above light compensation. However, in 0-4% light, growth rates were similar for intolerant and tolerant species, because low light together with higher respiration rates for intolerant species limited the expression of their growth potential differences. Deciduous and evergreen intolerant species were similar in many respects. However, both intermediate and tolerant deciduous species had markedly lower leaf mass ratios and higher root mass ratios than intermediate and tolerant evergreen species. In addition, deciduous species and intolerant evergreens must cope with as much as sixfold higher leaf turnover rates than tolerant evergreen species. Thus, rather than maximizing growth rates in low light, tolerant evergreen species minimize biomass loss through long leaf lifespans and low respiration rates. Tolerant deciduous species also minimize biomass losses by minimizing whole-plant respiration rates but they accomplish low biomass turnover though low leaf mass ratio and not low leaf turnover rates. Furthermore, unlike most tropical evergreens, tolerant deciduous species can gain large fractions of their total growing season carbon during short periods when the overstory is leafless and then allocate this carbon to storage (as reflected by high root mass ratios) rather than new leaves. In conclusion, we found no support for the low-light-enhanced carbon capture model of shade tolerance as viewed strictly from the perspective of physiological growth capacity. This can be explained by the disadvantages to net growth and survival of maintaining a high growth potential at low light, because high growth potential results in greater rates of whole-plant respiration, tissue turnover, herbivory and mechanical damage and in decreased storage. Thus, shade tolerance can be characterized by traits that maximize survival and net growth, where net growth includes losses to all agents.;;;;;4th New Phytologist Symposium on At the Crossroads of Plant Physiology and Ecology, at the Meeting of the ENSA-M;OCT, 1998;;MONTPELLIER, FRANCE;210;7;195;5;223;0028-646X;;WOS:000081916300014;

We tested experimentally whether the negative relationship between foliar defence and litter decomposition rate is fundamental, i.e. whether it is seen consistently across higher plant species and life forms, and whether it is repeated in the floras of geographically and climatically distinct areas separated by an ocean. We employed the published results of two outdoor litter bag experiments, in which we simultaneously compared the relative mass losses ('decomposibility') of leaf litters of a wide range of plant species. One experiment was in Cordoba, Argentina, and included 48 Argentine species typical of the dry, subtropical landscapes along a steep altitudinal gradient. The other was in Sheffield, UK, and hosted 72 British species typical of the temperate-Atlantic landscape there. We linked the two experiments through a similar experiment in Sheffield that hosted litters of subsets of both the Argentine and British species. We also tested fresh leaves of all species from the same areas for tensile strength ('toughness') and relative palatability to generalist herbivorous snails in multi-species 'cafeteria' experiments. Both in Argentina and in Great Britain there were highly significant correlations between leaf palatability (r = 0.61; 0.73) or leaf tensile strength (r = -0.60; -0.60) and litter mass loss across all species. These relationships could be explained by variation both between and within broad life-form groups. Specific leaf area (area:dry mass) of fresh leaves was consistently correlated only with litter mass loss within British life form groups. We illustrated the possible ecosystem consequences of these relationships by comparing functional traits of British species differing in leaf habit. In comparison with deciduous species, evergreens generally had innately slow growth, which corresponded to their longer-lived leaves of lower specific leaf area, higher tensile strength and lower palatability to generalist invertebrate herbivores. Correspondingly, evergreens produced more resistant leaf litter. Thus, slow-growing evergreens might maintain their position in infertile ecosystems through leaf traits that help them to conserve their nutrients efficiently and to keep nutrient mineralization low, thereby not allowing potentially fast-growing deciduous species to outcompete them.";;;;;4th New Phytologist Symposium on At the Crossroads of Plant Physiology and Ecology, at the Meeting of the ENSA-M;OCT, 1998;;MONTPELLIER, FRANCE;202;7;188;0;211;0028-646X;;WOS:000081916300018;

A comparison was made between crown development in closed understorey forest sites (low light) and in canopy gaps (high light); development was expressed by plant traits at multiple levels of organisation.Dicorynia and Vouacapoua responded to gap creation at all organisational levels, but not for all traits. Both species increased their light interception efficiency in the understorey. Firstly, understorey trees produced relatively wide crowns because they did not favour the growth of shoots in the summit of the crown, as did gap trees. Secondly, they reduced self-shading (expressed by leaf area index) by lower sympodial unit production rates, lower leaf production rates per growth unit (only Vouacapoua), and smaller leaf size (only Dicorynia). The reduction in self-shading was weakened by other traits that had the opposite effect on self shading (e.g. longer leaf life span in understorey), and cannot be considered an adaptive response in itself. (3) Understorey trees of Vouacapoua reduced leaf display costs by producing a higher specific leaf area, a shorter space among leaves, a smaller leaf spacing to leaf size ratio, and a longer leaf life span. Thus, all traits contributed to the more economical use of carbon in the understorey. Dicorynia showed the same trends, but not significantly.These results suggest that light availability plays a major role in the development and morphology of trees through its influences at multiple levels of organisation within the crown hierarchy. The two species studied were rather similar in their response at crown level, while they sometimes differed in their responses at the underlying lower organisational levels. The response directions of some individual plant traits were similar for the tall trees studied here and small saplings studied elsewhere. Some of traits investigated here may not be important in the crown level responses of smaller seedlings and saplings, while they are important mechanisms for crown level responses in taller trees.";;;;;;;;;31;0;27;1;31;1385-0237;;WOS:000082532000009;

Gas exchange is strongly seasonal in temperate deciduous forests; however, virtually no studies have described measurements made at the leaf scale through the whole growing season. This level of detail is important to understanding processes as substantial differences may occur within the canopy between species and between sun and shade leaves.2. Gas exchange was measured weekly throughout the growing season in leaves of Oak (Quercus robur) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) trees at Wytham Woods, UK. In Q. robur sun, shade and intermediate leaves were sampled on each occasion.3. Acer pseudoplatanus came into leaf before Q. robur and commenced net assimilation (A) earlier. Maximum irradiance saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)) in Q. robur were reached approximately 50 days after budburst and were maintained until approximately 20 days before abscission. Acer pseudoplatanus lost its leaves before Q. robur in the autumn and showed no seasonal trend in A(max). The lag between budburst and attainment of maximum photosynthetic rate in Q. robur was substantial and represented a quarter of the potential growing season.4. A(max) of A. pseudoplatanus (3.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) sun leaves was substantially lower than that of Q. robur (10.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) despite A. pseudoplatanus being a fast-growing species. The earlier flushing of A. pseudoplatanus leaves in the spring could not completely compensate for this. It is likely that other variables, such as total leaf area, are responsible for the high growth rate of A. pseudoplatanus, rather than high photosynthetic rates.5. Shade leaves of Q. robur had lower A(max) and mean A than sun leaves; their quantum efficiency was also lower. Consistent with this, sun leaves had a higher nitrogen content per unit area, resulting from a lower specific leaf area (SLA).6. Week to week variations in solar radiation influenced A; this could be described by a non-rectangular hyperbola. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreased in conditions of high vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, this did not decrease A as high VPD was associated with high solar radiation and the stimulation of photosynthesis caused by high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) more than compensated for the reduction by VPD.";;;;;;;;;49;3;43;0;52;0269-8463;;WOS:000081534300006;

Crown width, crown ratio, leaf biomass and leaf area decreased significantly with an increase in density. However, crown shape ratio, leaf area projection and leaf area ratio did not vary significantly with stand density, and specific leaf area decreased with the degree of crown closure and crown depth, which indicated that this hybrid shows a high degree of plasticity in response to competition.

Survival of these populations in the presence of competitive alien plants suggested 2 possibilities: 1) that Idaho fescue produces seedlings that successfully compete for soil resources with alien invaders, and 2) that Idaho fescue seedlings tolerate stress caused by resource uptake by alien neighbors. We compared germination and growth of Idaho fescue from an undisturbed population with that of conspecific populations from disturbed (grazed and invaded) sites to determine whether disturbed-site seedlings had greater potential for resource capture. Recruitment in Idaho fescue from degraded sites did not appear to be aided by rapid seed germination or greater tolerance of moisture stress during germination. A greater proportion of seeds from the undisturbed site germinated; they germinated faster, and were no more sensitive to water stress, than were seeds from disturbed sites. For both groups, decreasing water potential from 0 to -0.5 MPa had little effect on germination percentages but declined at -1 Mpa. Germination rates slowed with decreasing water potential. Though Idaho fescue from undisturbed and disturbed sites extended roots down the soil profile with equal speed, seedlings from the undisturbed site produced 3.5 times more root length, had 2.7 times greater root length density, and 3.4 times more leaf area than disturbed-site Idaho fescue. The higher growth rate and greater root length density in Idaho fescue from the undisturbed site translates to greater exploration and exploitation of the environment. The 2 Idaho fescue groups had equivalent specific root length, specific leaf area, and root weight ratio. Idaho fescue from disturbed sites showed strong, positive geotropic growth whereas branching and diageotropic growth were greater in Idaho fescue from the undisturbed site. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) extended roots faster than did Idaho fescue, with 17 times the root length, 6 times the root length density, and 10.8 times the leaf area of undisturbed-site Idaho fescue. Cheatgrass and Idaho fescue had equivalent specific leaf area, but specific root length of Idaho fescue was nearly twice that of the alien. Roots accounted for about 31% and 55% of cheatgrass biomass. Competitive ability did not appear to promote recruitment in Idaho fescue populations on degraded rangelands. Idaho fescue seedlings from the undisturbed-site were better competitors than disturbed-site seedlings, but interference from neighboring cheatgrass most strongly inhibited shoot growth of both Idaho fescue and cheatgrass. Idaho fescue had little effect on cheatgrass shoot growth. Selection of stress-tolerant genotypes from original populations may best explain the continued existence of Idaho fescue on grazed and invaded sites. We suggest that tolerance of moisture stress combined with vegetative longevity, are mechanisms behind Idaho fescue's persistence.";;;;;;;;;4;0;6;0;6;0022-409X;;WOS:000079521600015;

We found the following consistent responses. (1) All species grew faster at elevated CO2, whereas the following leaf and allocation traits were consistently lower in CO2-enriched environments: specific leaf area (quotient of leaf area and leaf weight), leaf area ratio (quotient of total leaf area and plant weight), weight-based foliar N concentration and, to a smaller extent, leaf weight fraction (quotient of leaf weight and plant weight). (2) There was important interspecific variation in the magnitude of the response of relative growth rate to CO2. Specific leaf area at ambient CO2 explained 88% of the variation in relative growth rate response to CO2 among the eight species. At ambient CO2, relative growth rate itself, was significantly correlated with the relative growth rate response to CO2 only if the leafless species Ulex gallii was excluded from analysis. (3) The four deciduous species had a significantly stronger relative growth rate response to CO2 than the four evergreens. This corresponded with their generally higher specific leaf area. (4) Specific leaf area and leaf habit might be useful for scaling up exercises, as easy-to-measure substitutes for growth responses of (woody) vegetation to elevated CO2.

Seedlings were grown under controlled, favourable conditions and measurements were made for various growth, morphological and allocation traits.2 Trait correlations across all species were identified, particularly with respect to seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA), a fundamental measure of allocation strategy that reflects the light-capture area deployed per unit of photosynthate invested in leaves.3 Across all species, SLA, specific root length (SRL) and seed reserve mass were the strongest predictors of seedling RGR. That is, a syndrome of leaf and root surface maximization and low seed mass was typical of high RGR plants. This may be a high-risk strategy for individual seedlings, but one presumably mitigated by a larger number of seedlings being produced, increasing the chance that at least one will find itself in a favourable situation.4 Syndromes of repeated attribute divergence were identified in the two sets of gradient PICs. Species from lower resource habitats generally had lower SLA. Thus, in this important respect the two gradients appeared to be variants of a more general 'stress' gradient.5 However, trends in biomass allocation, tissue density, root morphology and seed reserve mass differed between gradients. While SLA and RGR tended to shift together along gradients and in within-habitat PICs, no single attribute emerged as the common, primary factor driving RGR divergences within contrasts. Within-habitat attribute shifts were of similar magnitude to those along gradients.;;;;;;;;;161;7;157;0;170;0022-0477;;WOS:000078762300008;

While LAR, which represents the relative size of assimilatory apparatus, was little affected, net photosynthetic rate (P-N) saturated with radiant energy decreased with increasing Mn supply in all species. Thus P-N was adversely affected by high accumulation of Mn in leaves, which resulted in an overall reduction in biomass production.

Leaf-area-based rates of net photosynthesis increased between 13 and 36% among species in plants grown and measured in elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2. These CO2-induced increases in net photosynthesis were greater for slower-growing Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P., Pinus banksiana Lamb., and Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch than for faster-growing Populus tremuloides Michx. and Betula papyrifera Marsh., paralleling longer-term growth differences between CO2 treatments. Measures at common CO2 concentrations revealed that net photosynthesis was down-regulated in plants grown at elevated CO2. In situ leaf gas exchange rates varied minimally across temperature treatments and, contrary to predictions, increasing growth temperatures did not enhance the response of net photosynthesis to elevated CO2 in four of the five species. Overall, the species exhibited declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration, and increases in total nonstructural carbohydrates in response to CO2 enrichment. Consequently, the elevated CO2 treatment enhanced rates of net photosynthesis much more when expressed on a leaf area basis (25 %) than when expressed on a leaf mass basis (10%). In all species, rates of leaf net CO2 exchange exhibited modest declines with increasing plant size through ontogeny. Among the conifers, enhancements of photosynthetic rates in elevated CO2 were sustained through time across a wide range of plant sizes. In contrast, for Populus tremuloides and B. papyrifera, mass-based photosynthetic rates did not differ between CO2 treatments. Overall, net photosynthetic rates were highly correlated with relative growth rate as it varied among species and treatment combinations through time.

Saplings were grown for 70 d in controlled environments, wherein CO2 mole fractions averaged either 356 mu mol mol(-1) or 645 mu mol mol(-1), under a PPF of 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). On day 49 of the study, 50 % of the leaf area was removed from a subset of each species in both CO2 environments. Relative growth rate (RGR) and its physiological and morphological determinants were monitored before and after defoliation. For non-defoliated saplings of both species, a slight stimulation of RGR (c. 5 %) in elevated CO2 led to a modest increase (9-11 %) in final sapling weight. In the case of maple, the minimal growth response corresponded with minor CO2 effects on specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR), and an apparent CO2-induced down-regulation of photosynthetic metabolism. For aspen, the CO2 stimulation of photosynthesis was largely offset by a decrease in SLA. Responses to defoliation differed markedly between species and CO2 environments. Defoliation decreased maple RGR in ambient CO2, whereas the opposite occurred in elevated CO2. The latter led to complete recovery of plant weight (compensation), and was attributed to a defoliation-induced increase in carbon allocation to new leaves, along with a reversal of photosynthetic CO2 acclimation in that foliage. In both environments, aspen RGR increased after defoliation, facilitating almost full compensation. Defoliation increased light penetration into the aspen canopy, and it was estimated that the resultant stimulation of photosynthesis in lower leaves would have more than offset the concomitant decrease in LWR. CO2 enrichment might substantially enhance the ability of certain tree species to recover from herbivory. Moreover, responses to elevated CO2 might be largest in the presence of stresses, such as herbivory, that decrease plant source:sink ratios.;;;;;;;;;27;0;25;0;28;0028-646X;;WOS:000076565000009;

When plants were transferred from high light to low light (HL), their productivity and RGR (relative growth rate) were lower than plants under high light, bur, when plants were transferred from low light to high light (LH), they reached similar or higher RGR land sometimes biomass) compared to plants under continuously high light. The study species differed in their ability to explore and to benefit from the fertilized patch, depending on characteristics such as root length and root density in the fertilized patch and the potential relative growth rate of the species. The slow-growing species C. mexicanum showed no response to nutrient patches because it was unable to locate and produce roots in the patch. This species responded only to light, with slightly higher plant dry biomass and growth rate under HH and LL than under LH and LL, with thinner leaves (higher specific leaf area) under LL and LH. Fast-growing species had a higher ability than slow-growing species to forage for patchily distributed soil nutrients. This ability was maintained when plants experienced light increases (LH plants) but not when plants were growing under shaded conditions. In addition, the lack of the fertilized patch caused a strong reduction in RGR in the most productive light conditions (HH), so that HH plants had as low an RGR as LL and HL plants when grown without a fertilized patch. This response indicates a strong interaction between light capture and soil foraging behaviour.;;;;;;;;;12;2;12;1;14;0030-1299;;WOS:000075314900004;

The observed allocation patterns were not similar to the long-standing expectation for the phenotypic response of juvenile trees to shade, but were consistent with three hypothetical ""growth strategies"" in the understory: (1) the low SLA and LAR of A. saccharum may provide a measure of defense against herbivores and pathogens and thus promote persistence in the understory, (2) the high SLA for F. americana and high LAR for F. americana and A. rubrum may enable these species to achieve high growth rates in shade, and (3) the large carbohydrate stores of P. serotina may poise this species for opportunistic growth following disturbance.

The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span.2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light.3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA; SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span.4.

To test several hypotheses about acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis and respiration to differing light conditions, we investigated the interspecific relationships between leaf and root metabolism, chemistry and morphology in high and low light conditions for young seedlings of nine boreal tree species that differ in relative growth rate (RGR).2. Light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(sat)), whole-plat nitrogen (N) uptake rates, leaf and root respiration and morphology, and RGR all varied in parallel among the nine species when grown in both 5% and 25% of full sunlight. RGR, A(sat), leaf and root respiration (R-d), and N uptake rate per unit root mass or length differed significantly among species, ranking (from high to low): Populus, Betula and Larix SPP (all deciduous) and then to five evergreen conifers (Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp,), which were generally comparable in these measures.3, A(sat), leaf and root R-d and N uptake rates were all correlated (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9) with species traits, such as seed mass, leaf life span and shade-tolerance rankings. Mass-based A(sat) was greater in conifer seedlings raised in low than high light. In contrast, area-based A(sat) was higher for plants grown in high than low light, especially in the deciduous species. Once adjusted for differences in plant mass, leaf or root respiration rates did not differ for plants grown in low vs high light.4, Interspecific variation in RGR was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with rates of photosynthesis, respiration and N uptake. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates were correlated to specific leaf area and leaf N concentrations (r approximate to 0.9). Root respiraristi rates, N uptake rates, specific root length (root length per root dry mass) and root N concentrations were all highly correlated with each other (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9).

However, it is not known whether such scaling if it exists, is similar among disparate biomes and plant functional types. We tested this idea by examining the interspecific relationships between R-d measured at a standard temperature and leaf life-span, N, SLA and A(max) for 69 species from four functional groups (forbs, broad-leafed trees and shrubs, and needle-leafed conifers) in six biomes traversing the Americas. alpine tundra/subalpine forest, Colorado; cold temperate forest/ grassland, Wisconsin; cool temperate forest, North Carolina; desert/shrubland, New Mexico; subtropical forest, South Carolina; and tropical rain forest, Amazonas, Venezuela. Area-based R-d was positively related to area-based leaf N within functional groups and for all species pooled, but not when comparing among species within any site. At all sites, mass-based R-d (Rd-mass) decreased sharply with increasing leaf life-span and was positively related to SLA and mass-based A(max) and leaf N (leaf N-mass). These intra-biome relationships were similar in shape and slope among sites, where in each case we compared species belonging to different plant functional groups. Significant Rd-mass-N-mass relationships were observed in all functional groups (pooled across sites), but the relationships differed, with higher R-d at any given leaf N in functional groups (such as forbs) with higher SLA and shorter leaf life-span. Regardless of biome or functional group, Rd-mass was well predicted by all combinations of leaf life-span, N-mass and/or SLA (r(2) > 0.79, P < 0.0001). At any given SLA, Rd-mass rises with increasing N-mass and/or decreasing leaf life-span and at any level of N-mass, Rd-mass rises with increasing SLA and/or decreasing leaf life-span. The relationships between R-d and leaf traits observed in this study support the idea of a global set of predictable interrelationships between key leaf morphological, chemical and metabolic traits.";;;;;;;;;235;47;212;2;288;0029-8549;;WOS:000073964200004;

H and RI were independent. All allometric relationships between H and the parameters of plant biomass and dimensions were positively affected by RI, signifying that at a common H, saplings increased horizontal growth relative to vertical growth in environments with greater irradiance. Root mass ratio (coarse plus fine roots per total plant biomass) increased with increasing irradiance in both species and was not different between the species. However, Q. robur had a larger stem mass ratio, while A. platanoides had a greater leaf mass ratio (LMR). At a common irradiance, leaf mass per area (LMA) was lower in A. platanoides. As a result of these interspecific differences in fractional allocation of sapling biomass in foliage and biomass requirement for construction of foliar surface area, leaf area ratio (LAR = LMR/LMA) was larger in A. platanoides. Relative growth rate of standing biomass (RGR) was significantly correlated with RI in both species and was not different between the species. In contrast, net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR) was larger in Q. robur. Thus, in these species a similar RGR (NAR X LAR) was achieved in a completely different way: A. platanoides increased the intercepting foliar area, while Q. robur increased the productivity per unit area. Growth analysis repeated on a nitrogen basis demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency (biomass increment per unit nitrogen) was similar between the species, and that the species differences in NAR resulted from different foliar N concentrations; fractional nitrogen investment in foliage was independent of species. but lower nitrogen cost of leaves allowed A. platanoides to construct a more extensive foliar display with the same nitrogen investment in foliage. Biomass allocation between different compartments was also dependent on sapling size. With increasing H, A. platanoides maintained a constant proportion of biomass in foliage, but the relative amount of foliage decreased in Q. robur. Therefore, due to a decreasing investment of resources in foliage construction with advancing sapling ontogeny, saplings of similar height require more light to survive in Q. robur than in A. platanoides. Greater investment of biomass in leaves vs. standing biomass may result in lower volume pain and reduced competitive ability in more open habitats in A. platanoides. These results indicate that interspecific differences in allometry and nitrogen allocation patterns significantly alter species competitive relations during sapling development across the gap-understory continuum.";;;;;;;;;40;2;38;0;42;1058-5893;;WOS:000072789100018;

To test several hypotheses related to these issues, we examined the physiological, morphological and growth responses of six perennial species grown at various atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone. The species involved (two C-3 trees: Populus tremuloides Michx., Quercus rubra L.; two C-3 grasses: Agropyron smithii Rybd., Koeleria cristata L.; two C-4 grasses: Bouteloua curtipendula Michx., Schizachyrium scoparium Michx.) differed in growth form, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic pathway. In situ photosynthesis, relative growth rate (RGR) and its determinants (leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio and root weight ratio) were determined via sequential harvests of seedlings that were grown in all combinations of 366 or 672 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and 3 or 95 nmol mol(-1) O-3 over a 101-d period. Elevated CO2 had minimal effect on either photosynthesis or RGR. By contrast, RGR for all six species was lower in high O-3 concentrations at ambient CO2, significantly so in A. smithii and P. tremuloides. Five of the six species also exhibited reductions in in situ photosynthesis at ambient CO2 in high-O-3-grown compared with low-O-3-grown plants. For all species, these O-3-induced reductions in RGR and photosynthesis were absent in the elevated CO2 environment. Root weight ratio was significantly reduced by elevated O-3 in A. smithii and P. tremuloides in ambient but not elevated CO2. Species with high stomatal conductance were the most susceptible to oxidant injury, while those with low stomatal conductance, such as the C-4 species and Q. rubra, were not as detrimentally affected by O-3. Elevated levels of CO2 will reduce stomatal conductance and O-3 uptake, and might therefore reduce the potential for oxidant damage. However, there was a stronger relationship of the percent reduction in whole-plant mass due to O-3, related to the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance. In general, results of this study of six functionally diverse plant species suggest that O-3 pollution effects on carbon balance and growth are likely to be ameliorated by elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2.";;;;;;;;;88;5;76;0;96;0028-646X;;WOS:000072584200013;

The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes.The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C-S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance.A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region.The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance.The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.";;;;;;;;;477;43;458;6;537;0032-079X;;WOS:000073701100005;

Irradiance influences growth directly through differences in carbon gain, and indirectly through differences in carbon partitioning. In this paper we present an analysis of the morphological and physiological factors influencing the growth rates of tropical tree seedlings with different ecological strategies.A compilation was made of published data on relative growth rates and biomass allocation of species in contrasting light environments. The compilation encompasses 43 studies and 194 species. All morphological characteristics show ontogenetic trends. Stem mass ratio (SMR) increases with plant mass, mainly at the expense of the leaf mass ratio (LMR). A concomitant decrease in specific leaf area (SLA) leads to reduced leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and hence, a lower relative growth rate (RGR) when plants increase in size. Pioneers grow faster than shade-tolerant species, not only in high light but also in low-light conditions. In low light LAR explains interspecific differences in RGR, whereas in high light differences in net assimilation rate (NAR) are more important.We then use these data and additional information on physiological processes to model carbon balances for the average pioneer and shade-tolerant species in both a low- and a high-light environment. Simulated photosynthetic carbon gain is higher in pioneers than in shade-tolerant species, in both light environments. This is due to a larger leaf area in low light, acid the combination of a larger leaf area and higher photosynthetic rates in high light. Patterns in biomass fractions and carbon partitioning are strikingly different. More than half of the assimilates are partitioned to the leaves (for respiration, the replacement of shed leaves and additional growth), a third is partitioned to the roots and only 15% to the stem. Stems are not a great burden on the carbon balance, due to their low respiration rates and long lifespan. At the whole plant level, respiration consumes the largest share of assimilates, followed by net growth. About 15% of the assimilates are invested in the replacement of shed plant parts.The ability of shade-tolerant species to tolerate shade, apparently reduces the maximal possible growth rate in high light. In contrast, specialization for growth in a high-light environment does not preclude reasonable growth in low light, but probably at the cost of an increased risk of mortality.;;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;105;0;99;1;107;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300019;

To this aim we use a large database with innate seedling mean relative growth rates (RGR) for 97 European woody species. Before we considered it legitimate to scale up from the species level, we first addressed some potential pitfalls due to plant analysis and RGR definition. Subsequently we evaluated the roles of seed reserves and ontogeny/allometry; the possible risks of extrapolation to other (natural) environments; and the role of intraspecific variation in innate mean RGR. None of these factors appeared to affect the broad RGR ranking of the species seriously. Close correlates of seedling mean RGR among woody species were leaf area ratio (LAR) as well as both LAR components, specific leaf area and leaf mass ratio. We then scaled up to larger species assemblages, focusing first on higher taxa and functional types. Higher taxa, life-form, leaf habit, xylem type, life strategy and successional status could each explain part of the interspecific variation in mean RGR. In many cases the contributions of individual factors could be teased out by holding other factors constant, or using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Some of the consistent findings were as follows: woody species belonging to more advanced dicot families grew innately faster than more primitive ones; angiosperm trees faster than gymnosperm trees; deciduous species faster than evergreens; woody climbers and scramblers faster than self-supporting life-forms; shrubs and subshrubs faster than trees; trees with bud-break early in spring and indeterminate shoot growth faster than trees with delayed phenology and determinate shoot growth. This was to some extent correlated with the xylem Vessel size distribution. Trees with ruderal features grew innately faster than more competitive trees, followed by relatively stress-tolerant trees. Pioneer trees tended to grow innately faster than late-successional ones. Then, we tentatively scaled up from innate seedling mean RGR to ecosystem properties. Mediated by nutrient conservation through leaf longevity and anti-herbivore defences, (often evergreen) slow-growing species were found to produce more persistent litter than (often deciduous) fast-growing ones. This could have implications for nutrient turn-over rates in ecosystems. Finally, the woody flora from western Europe's cool-temperate climate belt grew inherently faster than that from a woody flora in the Mediterranean belt, and perhaps faster than that from the Boreal belt.";;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;53;0;51;0;55;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300020;

Plants of the two species were exposed to a factorial combination of high (H) and low (L) light intensity and fertilized (+ Fp) and unfertilized (-Fp) nutrient patches for 50 days. Half of the plants from H were then transferred to L (HL treatment), and half of the plants from L were transferred to H (LH). The remaining plants were kept in their original light condition and grown for another 50 days. Plants were grown in these light and patch treatments alone (one plant per pot) and in interspecific competition (one plant per species resulting in two plants per pot). Both species exploited fertilized patches by increasing root biomass and length in the patch. This enhanced plant productivity and growth rate mainly under LH and HH conditions for Heliocarpus and the HH condition for Caesalpinia. When plants in the HH light environment were grown with an unfertilized patch, plant biomass and relative growth rates (RGRs) were even lower than under the LL light environment [(HH-Fp)< LL]. However, the combined activity of shoot and roots when above- and below-ground resources were temporally and spatially heterogeneous influenced plant productivity and growth rate. The benefit from light increase (LH) was reduced when grown with an unfertilized patch. Larger reductions in root biomass, length and density in the patch, and in plant biomass and RGR, were exhibited by Heliocarpus than by Caesalpinia. These results suggest a close relationship between root foraging and light capture, where the benefit of the exploitation of the patch will be reflected in whole-plant benefit, if enough light is captured above-ground. In addition, the results suggest a change in the expected plant responses to light due to heterogeneity in soil nutrients, even though the fertilized patch was only a small proportion of the total soil volume. Leaf characteristics such as specific leaf area responded only to light conditions and not to patchily distributed nutrients. Root characteristics responded more strongly to nutrient heterogeneity. Competition modified the pattern of foraging under both high- and low-light conditions in Heliocarpus by 50 days, and the ability to forage for a fertilized patch under LL after 100 days of growth for Caesalpinia. Even though plant growth and productivity are greatly reduced under low-light conditions (HL and LL), competition modifies the ability of species to forage for a rich patch (especially for the fast-growing species Heliocarpus).";;;;;;;;;30;5;33;1;39;0029-8549;;WOS:000077344700027;

The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35-75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpinia eriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendron mexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.";;;;;;;;;44;5;46;1;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000071009200006;

We present the results of growth and biomass after 4.5 years of CO2 exposure, one of the longest studies so far on deciduous tree species. We found that elevated CO2 led to a 58% increase in biomass at the end of the experiment. However, estimation of stem mass during the growing season showed that elevated CO2 did not affect relative growth rate during the fourth growing season, and therefore, that the large accumulation of biomass was the result of an early effect on relative growth rate in previous years. Trees grown in elevated CO2 invested more carbon into fine roots and had relatively less leaf area than trees grown in ambient CO2, In contrast with previous studies, acceleration of growth did not involve a significant decline in nutrient concentrations of any plant tissue. It is likely that increased fine root density assisted the trees in meeting their nutrient demands. Changes in the species composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the trees grown in elevated CO2 in favour of late successional species supports the hypothesis of an acceleration of the ontogeny of the trees in elevated CO2.

Seedlings of 81 woody species from the temperate zone of western Europe were grown in a standard laboratory environment with standard, near-optimal nutrient availability. Weight-based leaf N content (N-wght) was positively correlated with mean relative growth rate (RGR), but the correlation with mean RGR was tighter when leaf N was expressed on a whole-plant weight basis: leaf nitrogen weight ratio (LNWR). Area-based leaf N content (N-area) was not associated with mean RGR, but was closely correlated with the quotient of saturated leaf weight and leaf area. Weight-based leaf K content (K-wght) was a close correlate of the saturated/dry weight ratio of the foliage, Within the lower range, K-wght corresponded with growth-related nutrient attributes, but higher values appeared to indicate succulence or remobilisable stored water. Functional groups of species and genera could be distinguished with respect to seedling leaf nutrient attributes. Deciduous woody climbers and scramblers had consistently higher leaf N-wght, LNWR and (apparently) leaf K-wght than other deciduous species or genera, and shrubs had higher values than trees. These differences seemed due partly to variation in specific leaf area. Evergreens had consistently higher leaf N-area than deciduous plants, but there were no significant differences in weight-based leaf nutrient attributes between these two groups, possibly because of 'luxury nutrient consumption' by the slow-growing evergreens. Another functional group was that of the nitrogen-fixing species, which had consistently high innate leaf N-wght compared to non-N-fixers. The ecological significance of the leaf nutrient attributes in this study is discussed by comparing the seedling data with those from field-collected material, and by brief reference to the natural habitats of the species.;;;;;;;;;98;2;90;0;101;0029-8549;;WOS:A1997XR38100003;

The objective was to investigate the sun-shade acclimation characteristics of this species. High-light grown plants (HL) had higher light saturated rates of photosynthesis than low-light plants (LL). No significant difference in dark respiration was observed between light regimes. Relative growth rate was initially (at 22 d) higher for HL, becoming similar between treatments in the last two harvests (44 and 66 d). Leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were higher for LL. Allocation of biomass to leaves was similar between treatments, while biomass allocated to roots was higher in HL. Allocation of biomass to stems was higher in LL. Leaves grown under high irradiance had less nitrogen per unit of mass and more per unit of area than leaves developed at low irradiance. These results suggest that light is important to the performance of this species and that the differential responses to light conditions may contribute to or detract from its ability to succeed in natural and agricultural environments or to endure control strategies.;;;;;;;;;8;0;6;13;18;0100-204X;;WOS:A1997XT66900004;

Mean values of relative growth rate (RGR), Unit leaf rate (ULR), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight fraction (LWF), specific leaf area (SLA), and the root-shoot allometric coefficient were derived.In herbaceous species, the grand mean RGR was 0.20 d(-1), comparable to values previously recorded. For woody species, the mean was 0.09 d(-1). An existing assumption linking high RGR to high allocation to photosynthetic biomass was upheld by comparisons made between groups. Within groups, however, no pattern of this kind could be demonstrated.When photosynthetically active radiation was increased from 125 to 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), ULR was increased almost pro rata. The parallel response in RGR was only slight, being offset by considerable reductions in LAR. The apparent mean quantum yield for photosynthesis in herbaceous species (whole-plant d. wt basis) was 0.60 g mol(-1).There was no significant dependence of RGR on ULR in any of the three groups of species, although the absolute magnitude of ULR declined in the order: herbaceous monocotyledons > herbaceous dicotyledons > woody dicotyledons. In all three groups, RGR was strongly dependent upon LAR but no differences emerged in absolute scale of LAR. The absolute scale of mean LWF decreased from herbaceous to woody species, but the dependence of LAR on LWF strengthened. Groups showed no systematic differences in magnitude of SLA, but the correlation of LAR with SLA was strong throughout.Multiple regression showed that the leading determinants of RGR were ULR and SLA in herbaceous species and LWF in woody species. Principal components analyses (PCA) on each of the three groups explained at least 77% of variation and agreed closely with an optimal (non-hierarchical) classification. Only six cluster 'types' were recognized out of the 16 theoretically possible combinations of 'high' or 'low' values of the four growth parameters. Strong evidence of evolutionary trade-offs emerged, most strikingly in that high RGR was never seen in combination with low SLA. The morphological/physiological types identified by an all-groups PCA separated woody from the herbaceous species, but dicotyledons were almost congruent with the monocotyledons.The non-growth-analytical attributes most strongly correlated with mean RGR were percentage yield at a low level of mineral nutrients, leaf nitrogen concentration, and seed weight. It was concluded that mean RGR plays a central role in the identification of pathways of evolutionary specialization in herbaceous species.;;;;;;;;;145;2;140;0;152;0028-646X;;WOS:A1997WR13500001;

Relative growth rate (RGR) showed no overall relationship with species site requirements, although RGR of fertile-site species tended to be more responsive to nutrient supply In the low-nutrient treatment, infertility-tolerant Fitzroya cupressoides showed a higher RGR rank than a fertility-demanding species (Laurelia philippiana) which outgrew it substantially at the highest supply rate. This reversal of RGR ranks was associated with divergent nutrient use responses: at high nutrient supply both spp. had similar plant nitrogen concentrations (PNC), whereas at the low supply rate Fitzroya's production of biomass per unit of assimilated N was twice that of Laurelia's. However, this pattern does not appear to serve as a general explanation of the respective distributions. of the study species, as RGR ranks of most species were unaltered by nutrient supply. At low nutrient availability, no clear differences in shoot:root ratio (SRR) were apparent between poor-site and fertile-site species. However, at high nutrient availability, SRR was markedly higher in the latter, resulting from differences in biomass allocation to stems (not leaves). Leaf area ratios (LAR) were higher in fertile-site species than in those tolerant of low fertility, because of differences in specific leaf area rather than leaf weight ratio. Very high LAR at high nutrient supply was characteristic of most shade-tolerant angiosperms, but not of shade-tolerant conifers. Although PNC showed no overall differences between poor- and fertile-site species, sensitivity of PNC to external supply rate was greatest in two infertility-tolerant conifers. In contrast, the angiosperm Weinmannia trichosperma, although tolerant of low fertility, responded to increased nutrient supply with greatly increased RGR and little change in PNC. Results show little trait convergence between conifers and angiosperms in adaptation both to shade and to infertile soils; i.e. fitness of different taxa in a given environment may hinge on different trait combinations.";;;;;;;;;29;2;24;1;31;0029-8549;;WOS:A1997WH54700007;

Overall mortality in deep shade (0.3, 1.6%) was considerably lower in Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus catharticus, Viburnum lantana and V. opulus. Average mortality in deep shade on grassland soil was negatively correlated with embryo-cum-endosperm dry mass (EEM). Overall mortality in deep shade was significantly greater with higher nutrient supply.3 In 63% daylight relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively correlated with log EEM, and positively with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) at time of planting but not at final harvest, i.e. differences in RGR were determined more by unit leaf rate (rate of dry mass gain/leaf area) in the latter part of the experiment.4 The responses of the species to irradiance and nutrient supply were appreciably different. Cornus, Ligustrum, Prunus spinosa, Rhamnus, and Rosa increased yield strongly under high irradiance on nutrient-poor soil, and responded also markedly to nutrients. Viburnum lantana and Euonymus grew relatively slowly in all treatments, but the former was responsive to nutrients, even in deep shade. Viburnum opulus was more responsive to irradiance but responded to nutrients only in 11% daylight. Crataegus grew more slowly on its 'own' soil than on grassland soil. Juniperus differed consistently from the other species, growing slowly, and responding strongly to irradiance. Fagus responded moderately to irradiance and not to nutrient supply.5 In shade allocation to roots decreased, while allocation to stem and to leaves increased generally. All species produced a smaller number and total area of leaves, and increased SLA and leaf area ratio (leaf area/total dry mass). Shoot and root lengths were reduced in shade.6 The results are discussed in relation to the roles of the various species during secondary succession, and their regeneration niches.;;;;;;;;;116;7;106;1;123;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996WB58300003;

This study aimed firstly at identifying easily measurable correlates of mean RGR of temperate zone woody species. Secondly, it tested the hypothesis that functional groups of woody plants could be characterized by their mean RGR and associated allocation and leaf attributes.2 In a standardized experiment, 80 woody species from the British Isles and North Spain, ranging widely in leaf habit and life-form, were screened for seed weight and potential seedling mean relative growth rate (RGR), biomass allocation and leaf attributes.3 Mean RGR, when based on plant weights excluding any attached thick cotyledons, was linearly and closely correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR, total leaf area/plant dry weight) and one of the two components of LAR, specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry weight). The other component, leaf weight fraction (leaf weight/plant dry weight), was only correlated with mean RGR when based upon true leaves, disregarding leafy cotyledons. These relationships were also demonstrated when taxonomic relatedness was accounted for.4 The data supported the hypothesis that differentiation, as seen among functional groups of species in terms of leaf habit and life-form, corresponded with differentiation in mean RGR and other seedling attributes. For instance, deciduous species grew consistently faster than evergreens.5 When SLA was split into its two components, specific saturated leaf area (SSLA, total leaf area/total saturated leaf weight) and leaf saturated weight/dry weight ratio (SW/DW), it was found that SSLA was consistently smaller in evergreens than in deciduous species, both for sclerophyllous and succulent leaves. Among species of the same leaf habit, variation in SLA among life-forms could be explained by variation in leaf SW/DW.6 SSLA and leaf SW/DW both easy to measure, together could help to categorize growth rate within the evergreen or deciduous species. This may be useful in vegetation monitoring.7 The data may provide useful predictive tools to infer potential growth rates and nutrient conservation strategies of real vegetation from the functional attributes and composition of its functional species groups.;;;;;;;;;196;15;193;2;215;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996VU80400011;

Seedlings were grown for 4 months at a common site on contrasting forest soils from a wet evergreen forest and a moist semi-deciduous forest and at five irradiances, which mimicked variation in irradiance from single tree falls to cleared land.3. Pioneer species responded differently to irradiance by showing higher maximum relative growth rates (>30 mg g(-1) day(-1)) and unit leaf rates (>3.0 g m(-2) day(-1)) than non-pioneer shade-bearers (<22 mg g(-1) day(-1) and <2.1 g m(-2) day(-1), respectively). Particularly at the irradiance level below 8% of ambient, pioneers also showed higher leaf area ratios (>220 cm g(-1)) and specific leaf areas (>400 cm g(-1)) compared to shade-bearers. Non-pioneer light-demanders showed intermediate responses to differences in irradiance.4. The soil from the wet evergreen forest was more acid (pH less than or equal to 4.87) than the soil from moist semi-deciduous forest (pH greater than or equal to 6.12). It also had lower concentrations of total N and available P, K, Ca and Mn, particularly in the topsoil. Seedlings grown in wet evergreen forest soil showed reduced leaf foliar concentrations of P, Ca and Mg and to a lesser extent N, compared with those grown in moist semi-deciduous forest soil, but the response varied between species. Foliar nutrient concentrations, particularly of P and Mg, were lowest in species naturally restricted to wet evergreen forest.5. The non-pioneer light-demander Mansonia altissima and the pioneer T. scleroxylon showed an increase of 300% and 100%, respectively, in maximum RGR when grown in the more fertile soil type. In contrast, RGR of the pioneer L. alata was increased by 80% in the less fertile soil. Species-specific differences in growth response, biomass allocation and foliar nutrient concentration may explain why some species are restricted to more fertile soils.

This study provides evidence for the existence of general intrinsic patterns controlling the maximum growth rate of photosynthetic organisms, based on a compilation of data from more than 120 reports, the species ranging from unicellular algae to trees and thick-leaved desert plants.2. We used thickness and nutrient concentration of the photosynthetic tissue to scale differences in maximum growth rate among plants, based on the demonstrated importance of these plant traits in regulating the maximum growth rates of particular plant groups.3. The growth rate declined with increasing thickness of the photosynthetic structures and increased with increasing nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. The strong dependence of growth rate and nutrient concentrations on tissue thickness reflect broad-scale patterns and not the adaptive response of individual or closely related species of similar tissue thickness to varying environmental conditions.4. The scaling of maximum growth rate is similar to the scaling of metabolic rate to animal size. Thickness of the photosynthetic structures therefore plays an important role in the environmental control of plant performance and evolution, setting thresholds for the growth and productivity of photosynthetic organisms.;;;;;;;;;64;4;62;0;70;0269-8463;;WOS:A1996UV19200002;

To test the predicted relationship between growth rate and biomass allocation in relation to nutrient availability, seedlings of 34 woody species from the tropical deciduous forest in Mexico were grown under two contrasting nutrient conditions.2. Dry biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), root/shoot ratio (R/S), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), root weight ratio (RWR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and the nitrogen and carbon leaf percentage were determined following an initial and final harvest. In all the parameters evaluated, the trend followed by the species under low nutrient conditions was similar to the trend attained in high nutrient conditions but with different magnitude.3. The species with the largest seed biomass was Thevetia ovata (3808.6mg). Lagrezia monosperma had the smallest seeds (0.13 mg) and the highest RGR in the high nutrient treatment. However, the relationship between RGR and seed biomass among the 34 species studied was weak (r=-0.50 in low and -0.62 in high nutrients).4. Higher biomass allocation to roots Was shown under low nutrient condition but the relationship between RGR and root/shoot ratio was non-significant.5. Species variation in RGR to both the nutrient treatments employed is followed by species variations in LAR (r=0.50) more than changes in NAR (r=0.20). Changes in LAR are explained by LWR (r=0.62) and SLA (r=0.70). Under low and high nutrients, the RGR was highly correlated with SLA (r=0.67 and 0.60), suggesting the importance of both the total leaf area produced and the leaf morphological characteristics in determining the RGR.6. A general characteristic of the distribution of the species' responses in RGR to both nutrient treatments was the existence of a continuum, for all of the parameters studied. This suggests differences in the species' resource utilization and tolerance, which are reflected in different plastic capacities.;;;;;;;;;73;0;69;3;74;0269-8463;;WOS:A1995TU96300006;

Red oak and red ash showed different patterns of N-assimilation. Red oak seedlings assimilated NO3 in low amounts in their roots and leaves, whereas red ash seedlings assimilated high amounts of NO3, mostly in the leaves. A significant amount of constitutive NR activity was found in red oak seedlings supplied with NH4 N-regime. This could be characteristic of a species adapted to soils that are poor in nitrogen. Root GS activity was lower in red oak seedlings than in red ash seedlings, indicating that the rate of NH4 assimilation differed in these two hardwood species. Low irradiance reduced growth of both hardwood species, but greatly affected the specific leaf area of red ash and reduced NO3 assimilation (when data are expressed per leaf area).

Instantaneous carbon gain is known to increase in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, but it is uncertain whether this will translate into increased growth in the longer term under nutrient-limited conditions. An analytical model to address this question was developed by Comins and McMurtrie (1993, Ecological Applications 3, 666-681). Their model was further tested and analysed. Manipulation of various assumptions in the model revealed its key assumptions and allowed a more confident prediction of expected growth responses to CO2 enrichment under nutrient-limited conditions.The analysis indicated that conclusions about the CO2 sensitivity of production were strongly influenced by assumptions about the relationship between foliar and heartwood nitrogen concentrations. With heartwood nitrogen concentration proportional to foliar nitrogen concentration, the model predicted a strong response of plant productivity to increasing CO2 concentration, whereas with heartwood nitrogen concentration set constant, the model predicted only a very slight growth response to changing CO2 concentration. On the other hand, predictions were only slightly affected by: (1) assumptions about the extent of nitrogen retranslocation out of senescing roots and foliage or wood during heartwood formation; (2) the effects of nitrogen status on specific Leaf area or (3) leaf longevity; (4) carbon allocation between different plant parts; or (5) changes in the N:C ratio of organic matter sequestered in the passive pool of soil organic matter. Modification of the effect of foliar nitrogen concentration on the light utilization coefficient had only a small effect on the CO2 sensitivity for pines. However, this conclusion was strongly dependent on the chosen relationship between single-leaf photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen concentration. Overall, the analysis suggested that trees growing under nitrogen-limited conditions can respond to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration with considerable increases in growth.";;;;;;;;;84;2;65;0;84;0140-7791;;WOS:A1994PJ88600001;

Three Betulaceae species (Betula papyrifera, Betula alleghaniensis and Ostrya virginiana) were grown in high and low light and Quercus rubra and Acer saccharum were grown only in high light. plant traits were determined at four ages: 41, 62, 83 and 104 days after germination. In high light (610 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD), across species and ages, RGR was positively related to the proportion of the plant in leaves (leaf weight ratio, LWR; leaf area ratio, LAR), in situ rates of average canopy net photosynthesis (A) per unit mass (A(mass)) and per unit area (A(area)), and rates of leaf, stem and root respiration. In low light (127 mu mol m(-2), s(-1) PPFD), RGR was not correlated with A(mass) and A(area) whereas RGR was positively correlated with LAR, LWR, and rates of root and stem respiration. RGR was negatively correlated with leaf mass per area in both high and low light. Across light levels, relationships of CO2 exchange and morphological characteristics with RGR were generally weaker than within light environments. Moreover, relationships were weaker for plant parameters containing a leaf area component (leaf mass per area, LAR and A(area)), than those that were solely mass-based (respiration rates, LWR and A(mass)). Across light environments, parameters incorporating the proportion of the plant in leaves and rates of photosynthesis explained a greater amount of variation in RGR (e.g. LWR*A(mass), R(2)=0.64) than did any single parameter related to whole-plant carbon gain. RGR generally declined with age and mass, which were used as scalars of ontogeny. LWR (and LAR) also declined for seven of the eight species-light treatments and A declined in four of the five species in high light. Decreasing LWR and A with ontogeny may have been partially responsible for decreasing RGR. Declines in RGR were not due to increased respiration resulting from an increase in the proportion of solely respiring tissue (roots and stems). In general, although LWR declined with ontogeny, specific rates of leaf, stem, and root respiration also decreased. The net result was that whole-plant respiration rates per unit leaf mass decreased for all eight treatments. Identifying the major determinants of variation in-growth (e.g. LWR*A(mass)) across fight environments, species and ontogeny contributes to the establishment of a framework for exploring limits to productivity and the nature of ecological success as measured by growth. The generality of these relationships both across the sources of variation we explored here and across other sources of variation in RGR needs further study.";;;;;;;;;135;4;124;2;141;0029-8549;;WOS:A1993MH78700010;

Control seedlings were maintained in the same light regime throughout the study. The availability of light influenced relative growth rate through morphological and physiological adjustments. Transferred seedlings retained the leaves that had been developed before transfer, and no leaf-shedding was observed till the end of the experiment. Leaves formed in the new light regime were physiologically and morphologically identical to those of the corresponding controls. High-light seedlings transferred to low light displayed significantly lower relative growth rate than the low-light controls because of a lower leaf area ratio carried over from the previous high-light environment. A reverse pattern of response with respect to relative growth rate was observed for the low-light seedlings transferred to high light compared to the high-light controls. The higher relative growth rate in the low-light seedlings transferred to high light was the result of higher net assimilation rate and higher leaf area ratio. The higher leaf area ratio in the low-light seedlings transferred to high light was the consequence of the effects of previous environment, and die relatively lower net assimilation rate in the high-light control seedlings was, at least partly, due to the effects of self-shading rather than to the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves. The results suggest that the species has a wide acclimation potential to a change in light availability that might occur in nature following gap creation or canopy closure.";;;;;;;;;22;1;19;0;23;0829-318X;;WOS:A1993LW96200007;

Specific leaf area, maximum net photosynthesis per unit mass (A/mass), leaf N per unit mass (N(leaf)/Mass) and maximum net photosynthesis on a leaf N basis (A/N(leaf)) were inversely correlated to leaf longevity (r2 = 0.92-0.97, 0.91, 0.88 and 0.80, respectively). Maximum net photosynthesis per unit area (A/area) was not correlated to leaf longevity, whereas leaf N per unit area (N(leaf)/area) was positively correlated to leaf longevity (r2 = 0.95). For a similar-diameter conifer, species with long-lived foliage supported a greater foliage mass than species with short-lived foliage; however, Quercus rubra did not follow this pattern. At the stand level, total foliage mass ranged from 3.3 to 30.5 Mg ha-1 and was positively correlated (r2 = 0.97) to leaf longevity. Leaf area index (LAI) was also positively correlated (r2 = 0.82) to leaf longevity. Production efficiency (ANPP/LAI) was inversely related to leaf longevity and positively related to A/mass.

To find out which properties enable plant species to dominate in nutrient-poor habitats and which properties benefit species in nutrient-rich habitats, we studied the growth and morphology of eight perennial grass species from habitats with contrasting soil fertilities in a pot experiment under controlled conditions in a glasshouse.2. The species were grown under nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich conditions. Ranked from the least responsive to the most responsive to the supply of nutrients they were: Festuca ovina, F. rubra, Anthoxanthum odoratum, F. arundinacea, Alopecurus pratensis, F. pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Lolium perenne.3. The response correlated positively with the Ellenberg nitrogen number of the species. No differences in initial relative growth rate were found between the species, but after 4 weeks the plant dry weight increased with increasing nitrogen number as a result of variation in embryo plus endosperm weight.4. Species characteristic of nutrient-rich hayfields are taller and show a more homogeneous vertical distribution of photosynthetic area than the species from nutrient-poor habitats, which have most of their leaf area below 15 cm. Species from the nutrient-poor habitats allocated less dry matter to the roots and consequently more to the shoot, than species from nutrient-rich conditions. However, leaf and root morphology seem to be most clearly adapted to the habitat.5. Species from nutrient-rich habitats have a higher specific leaf area (SLA) than species from nutrient-poor habitats, while species from nutrient-poor habitats had more root length per unit root weight (SRL) than species from nutrient-rich habitats.;;;;;;;;;60;2;55;0;62;0269-8463;;WOS:A1993KY58100012;
SLA;J;"REICH, PB; WALTERS, MB; ELLSWORTH, DS";;;;;;;;LEAF LIFE-SPAN IN RELATION TO LEAF, PLANT, AND STAND CHARACTERISTICS AMONG DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS;;;;;;;;ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS;;;;62;3;;;365;392;;10.2307/2937116;;;sept-92;1992;Variation in leaf life-span has long been considered of ecological significance. Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life-span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns.Among all species, both mass- (A(mass)) and area-based (A(area)) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life-span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.70) than an area (P < .05, r2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass-based leaf nitrogen (leaf N(mass)) decreased (P < .001, r2 = 0.52) with leaf life-span, but area-based leaf N (leaf N(area)) did not (P > .25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life-span. Decreasing A(mass) with increasing leaf life-span results from the impact of decreasing N(mass) and SLA on A(mass). Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life-span was similar for broad-leaved and needle-leaved subsets of the data. These leaf-scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, N(mass), and A(mass)) the quantitative relationship with leaf life-span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. A(mass) was a linear function of N(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while A(area) was not significantly related to N(area). These results suggest that the photosynthesis-leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis.Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole-plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and A(mass)(r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and A(mass) and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life-span (P < .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with A(mass)(P < .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life-span and high leaf N(mass), SLA, LAR, and A(mass) interactively contribute to high growth rates in open-grown individuals.These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed-canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P < .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life-span or total foliage mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing A(mass), N(mass), and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaflife-spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life-span. Extended leaf life-span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand-level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life-span.We hypothesize that co-variation among species in leaf life-span, SLA, leaf N(mass), A(mass), and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short-term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand-level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf-span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as causally interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life-span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.;;;;;;;;;807;62;763;7;900;d_c-15;;WOS:A1992JJ41600003;

Punch-and-die (penetrometer) tests were also conducted. Intercostal material was analyzed for crude fibre and crude protein (total nitrogen concentration x 6.25) and the ratio of the two, the index of sclerophylly, calculated for each species. Leaf anatomy was examined and specific leaf area was calculated. Thirty-seven of the species were from three definable plant communities, namely mangroves, trema belukar (secondary forest on undegraded sites) and adinandra belukar (secondary forest on highly degraded soils).There was a highly significant positive correlation between fracture toughness and index of sclerophylly for the 42 species (R2 = 0.43, P < 0.001) brought about largely by a high correlation between toughness and crude fibre content. Fracture toughness was not correlated with lamina tissue dorsi-ventral thickness but high toughness was clearly associated with the presence of sclerenchyma bundle sheaths and sheath extensions. Analysis of the fracture path for 26 leaves of ten mangrove species showed a high correlation between the area fraction occupied by veins and fracture toughness if one species, Avicennia rumphiana, was excluded. The regression equation for the other nine species gave estimates of the fracture toughness of vein tissue and lamina matrix of 6053 and 327 J m-2 respectively. Punch-and-die test results only correlated well with the cutting tests when values were divided by lamina thickness.The ratio of protein to fibre in a leaf (the reciprocal of the index of sclerophylly) has been established as a good predictor of leaf palatability and digestibility to generalist chewing folivores. The high correlation between fracture toughness and the index of sclerophylly for a large sample suggests that leaf toughness could be the factor used as a proximate cue for determining food quality in herbivore foraging strategies.;;;;;;;;;156;3;142;5;163;0028-646X;;WOS:A1992JL02300012;

Rate of nutrient addition to Eucalyptus grandis seedlings influences rate of growth through three main physiological mechanisms: the effects of plant nutrient concentration on biomass partitioning, specific leaf area, and assimilation. A simple dynamic model is presented to describe growth of E. grandis seedlings in response to different relative addition rates of nitrogen and phosphorus as reflected in plant nutrient status. The model takes account of effects of nutrient concentrations on partitioning, specific leaf area and light saturated assimilation rate.Model simulations demonstrate the influence relative nutrient addition rate has on key processes that influence relative growth rate, and that the relative importance of each of these is dependent on plant nutrient status. If plants are deficient in nitrogen, changes in growth consequent upon improved nutrient status are mediated primarily through effects on assimilate partitioning and light saturated assimilation rate. If plants have high nitrogen status, changes in growth consequent upon improved nutrient status are mediated primarily through effects on specific leaf area. If plants are deficient in phosphorus, changes in growth consequent upon improved nutrient status are mediated through effects on assimilation. If plants have high phosphorus status, changes in growth consequent upon improved nutrient status are mediated through effects on both assimilation and specific leaf area.;;;;;;;;;22;1;22;0;24;0310-7841;;WOS:A1992JR54800002;

Regardless of the watering regime, plants with 'Meteor' scions and 'Colt' rootstocks maintained higher RBAR than plants with 'Colt' scions and 'Meteor' rootstocks. This enhanced growth occurred as a result of higher EBAR. Measurements on water-stressed plants also showed that the graft combination of 'Meteor' on 'Colt' had the lowest LARSA, while the reciprocal combination of 'Colt' on 'Meteor' had the highest.

The growth analysis includes both a conventional growth analysis and an integrated analysis of growth and environmental conditions. Survival was best after soil surface modification or weed control. Growth responses were positively related to increases in soil temperature and nutrient availability, and a decrease in vegetative competition. Yield component analysis indicated that Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) was positively related to improved growth. Changes in Specific Leaf Area tended to buffer the effects of changes in NAR on growth, however, and Relative Growth Rate (RGR) responded less to the treatments than did NAR. RGR was related to the availability of light, nitrogen, and soil energy or the efficiency of light, nitrogen, and soil energy use by seedlings on the three sites. As availability of a particular resource improved, growth allocation shifted away from tissues that are used to acquire that resource. Seedlings grew faster where treatments caused both the availability of a resource and the efficiency (growth/unit resource) of its use to increase. The analytical framework proposed has application in studying the responses of trees to environmental changes and in determining factors that limit tree growth.;;;;;;;;;55;0;43;0;55;0015-749X;;WOS:A1991FD75700006;

Animals that interact with plants could be selective agents on subindividual variation. This study examines selective pressures exerted during post-dispersal seed predation and germination on the subindividual variation of seed size in hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). With a seed offering experiment and a germination test, we estimated phenotypic selection differentials for average and subindividual variation of seed size due to seed predation and germination. Seed size affects germination, growth rate and the probability of an individual seed of escaping predation. Longer seeds showed higher germination rates, but this did not result in significant selection on phenotypes of the maternal trees. On the other hand, seed predators avoided wider seeds, and by doing so exerted phenotypic selection on adult average and subindividual variation of seed size. The detected selection on subindividual variation suggests that the levels of phenotypic variation within individual plants may be, at least partly, the adaptive consequence of animal-mediated selection.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1435-8603;;WOS:000337613000018;24176051

For example, Prosopis velutina has proliferated in many grasslands of the Sonoran Desert in North America over the past century, while other shrub species with similar growth form and life history, such as Acacia greggii, have not. We conducted a glasshouse experiment to assess whether differences in early seedling development could help explain why one species and not the other came to dominate many Sonoran Desert grasslands. We established eight watering treatments mimicking a range of natural precipitation patterns and harvested seedlings 16 or 17 days after germination. A. greggii had nearly 7 times more seed mass than P. velutina, but P. velutina emerged earlier (by 3.0 +/- 0.3 d) and grew faster (by 8.7 +/- 0.5 mg d(-1)). Shoot mass at harvest was higher in A. greggii (99 +/- 6 mg seedling(-1)) than in P. velutina (74 +/- 2 mg seedling(-1)), but there was no significant difference in root mass (54 +/- 3 and 49 +/- 2 mg seedling(-1), respectively). Taproot elongation was differentially sensitive to water supply: under the highest initial watering pulse, taproots were 52 +/- 19 mm longer in P. velutina than in A. greggii. Enhanced taproot elongation under favorable rainfall conditions could give nascent P. velutina seedlings growth and survivorship advantages by helping reduce competition with grasses and maintain contact with soil water during drought. Conversely, A. greggii's greater investment in mass per seed appeared to provide little return in early seedling growth. We suggest that such differences in recruitment traits and their sensitivities to environmental conditions may help explain ecological differences between species that are highly similar as adults and help identify pivotal drivers of shrub encroachment into grasslands.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1932-6203;;WOS:000330507300161;24475263

An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.;;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;5;0027-8424;;WOS:000329614500046;24379395

With a light level decrease from 20% to 5%, Q mongolica showed insignificant differences, but P. koraiensis exhibited a significant decrease in survival rate and NSC levels. The survival rates of P. koraiensis and Q mongolica seedlings were positively and significantly related to the NSC concentration in leaves (r(1) = 0.9898) and NSC concentration in roots (r(2) = 0.9976), respectively. These results suggested that: (1) full sunlight was the optimum light environment for the initial survival and growth of both tree species; (2) low light induced carbohydrate deficiency, which might be the key factor resulting in seedling mortality in forest understory; (3) different NSC allocation patterns in response to light alteration might promote the coexistence of P. koraiensis and Q. mongolica in the early stage of regeneration in the forest stands.

Suites of correlated functional traits may reflect fundamental tradeoffs and general plant strategies and hence represent trait spectra along which plant species can vary according to their respective strategies. However, the functional interpretation of these trait spectra requires the inspection of their relation to plant performance. We employed principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) to quantify fundamental whole-plant trait spectra based on 23 traits for 305 North American woody species that span boreal to subtropical climates. We related the major axes of PCoA to five measures of plant performance (i.e., growth rate, and tolerance to drought, shade, water-logging and fire) for all species and separately for gymnosperms and angiosperms. Across all species a unified gymnosperm-angiosperm trait spectrum (wood density, seed mass, rooting habit) is identified, which is correlated with drought tolerance. Apart from this, leaf type and specific leaf area (SLA) strongly separate gymnosperms from angiosperms. For gymnosperms, one trait spectrum emerges (seed mass, rooting habit), which is positively correlated with drought tolerance and inversely with shade tolerance, reflecting a tradeoff between these two strategies due to opposing trait characteristics. Angiosperms are functionally more diverse. The trait spectra related to drought tolerance and shade tolerance are decoupled and three distinct strategies emerge: high drought tolerance (low SLA, dense wood, heavy seeds, taproot), high shade tolerance (high SLA, shallow roots, high toxicity, opposite arranged leaves), and fast growth/stress intolerance (large maximum heights, soft wood, light seeds, high seed spread rate). In summary, our approach reveals that complex suits of traits and potential tradeoffs underlie fundamental performance strategies in forests. Studies relying on small sets of plant traits may not be able to reveal such underlying strategies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;2150-8925;;WOS:000327380400011;

Female-biased sex ratios are relatively rare in dioecious plants, and are not easily explained by costs of reproduction, which are often higher in females. In fact, data from reproductive adults in this population showed modular growth favoring males, which led to questions concerning the source of female-bias. Using seeds collected from 20 maternal plants in 1992, a garden study was conducted from 1993-2003 in which periodic flowering censuses were conducted, and plant size parameters were recorded. The plants were grown in a relatively tightly packed array which likely forced early intraspecific competition. The results suggested that L. benzoin females may compensate for differential costs of reproduction via larger initial seed size and early growth rate, but that sexual dimorphism in such a highly competitive scenario can favor males even more dramatically than in typical field conditions. Despite larger early size and faster growth in female seedlings, males showed clear advantages over females in the post-reproductive period and mortality was much higher in female genets. Sex ratios were close to the same level of female bias seen in the wild population around the time of initial flowering, but trended toward maleness as post-reproductive stage genet mortality ensued. Explanations for the development and persistence of female bias include larger seedling size that may give females a competitive advantage over males in the prereproductive stage, which under certain circumstances may lead to greater survival of female seedlings. Variation among habitats in herbivory and other environmental factors that influence survival and sex expression could ameliorate the competitive advantage of males associated with their lower reproductive costs.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;1095-5674;;WOS:000339655700006;

Here, we used a powerful sample size and a strong quantitative genetic approach to analyse the sources of variation of early seedling performance and to identify seed mass (SM)-dependent and -independent maternal environmental effects in Maritime pine. We measured SM of 8924 individual seeds collected from 10 genotypes clonally replicated in two environments of contrasting quality (favourable and stressful), and we measured seedling growth rate and biomass allocation to roots and shoots. SM was extremely variable (up to 14-fold) and strongly determined by the maternal environment and the genotype of the mother tree. The favourable maternal environment led to larger cones, larger seeds and reduced SM variability. The maternal environment also determined the offspring phenotype, with seedlings coming from the favourable environment being 35% larger and with greater root/shoot ratio. Transgenerational plasticity appears, thus, to be a relevant source of phenotypic variation in the early performance of this pine species. Seed provisioning explained most of the effect of the maternal environment on seedling total biomass. Environmental maternal effects on seedling biomass allocation were, however, determined through SM-independent mechanisms, suggesting that other epigenetic regulation channels may be involved.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0018-067X;;WOS:000323209400009;23652562

We evaluate the growth and survival of 24 tree species used for forest restoration in pastures in the wet tropics in Mexico for 42 months. We relate their performance to 13 underlying functional traits that are important for leaf display, tree architecture and reproduction. Pioneers realized both faster growth rates and higher survival than non-pioneer species. No consistent ontogenetic cross-overs in species growth and survival were found during 42 months, which implies that species performance early after planting (12 months) predicted performance well after 42 months, probably because environmental conditions changed little over time in these early-successional pastures. Nine out of 12 functional traits were good predictors of growth rates and/or survival measures across all 24 species or for pioneer or non-pioneer species separately. Growth rates and survival were positively related to crown size and negatively to seed mass, but they were - surprisingly - not related to the leaf traits we measured. Multivariate plant trait axes explained species growth rates and survival better than individual traits only for the non-pioneer species group. Selection of additional traits may be needed for better predictions of overall performance of restoration plantings. Combining the basic science of functional ecology with the applied goals of forest management and restoration allow us to select the best mid-term performing tree species for planting in pastures using a short-term screening of growth and survival rates. Pioneers and non-pioneer species with small seeds and large crown length are good candidates for plantings in pastures since they have the best mid-term performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This difference in growth rate is thought to reflect systematic variation in physiology, allocation and leaf construction. Previous studies documenting this effect have, however, ignored differences in seed mass. As woody species often have larger seeds and RGR is negatively correlated with seed mass, it is entirely possible the lower RGRs observed in woody species is a consequence of having larger seeds rather than different growth strategies. Using a synthesis of the published literature, we explored the relationship between RGR and growth form, accounting for the effects of seed mass and study-specific effects (e. g. duration of study and pot volume), using a mixed-effects model. The model showed that herbaceous species do indeed have higher RGRs than woody species, and that the difference was independent of seed mass, thus at all seed masses, herbaceous species on average grow faster than woody ones.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0962-8452;;WOS:000319385100021;23677351

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of similar to 130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.;;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;d_c-58;;WOS:000312892500013;23431593

Genome size was therefore used as a proxy for them in order to assess how common plant traits such as height, specific leaf area and seed size/number predict species regional abundance. In this study it is hypothesized that if there is residual correlation between genome size and abundance after these traits are partialled out, there must be additional ecological effects of cell size and/or cell-division rate.Methods Variation in genome size, plant traits and regional abundance were examined in 436 herbaceous species of central European flora, and relationships were sought for among these variables by correlation and path analysis.Key Results Species regional abundance was weakly but significantly correlated with genome size; the relationship was stronger for annuals (R-2 = 0145) than for perennials (R-2 = 0027). In annuals, genome size was linked to abundance via its effect on seed size, which constrains seed number and hence population growth rate. In perennials, it weakly affected (via height and specific leaf area) competitive ability. These relationships did not change qualitatively after phylogenetic correction. In both annuals and perennials there was an unresolved effect of genome size on abundance.Conclusions The findings indicate that additional predictors of regional abundance should be sought among variables that are linked to cell size and cell-division rate. Signals of these cell-level processes remain identifiable even at the landscape scale, and show deep differences between perennials and annuals. Plant population biology could thus possibly benefit from more systematic use of indicators of cell-level processes.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0305-7364;;WOS:000310892900002;22628380

Seedlings were grown and evaluated in a common garden test at Bamako, Mali. Germination was assessed and growth measured 3 and 12 months after germination. Leaf morphology (leaf length, leaflet number, petiole length and diameter and leaflet border) were assessed after 12 months. Significant differences between the provenances were observed for both growth rate and leaf morphology. West African provenances in general grew faster than East African provenances, but leaf characters did not reveal a particular geographic structure, and the correlations between geographic distances and multivariate Mahalanobis distances were not significant. The correlations between leaf morphological traits and climatic data were in general low at the provenance level. However, the number of leaflets was significantly higher for provenances from drier areas. Two years increment at a field site also varied significantly between the provenances, where West African provenances confirmed their tendency to higher growth rate. Still, trees are young and results regarding both growth data and leaf characteristics should be confirmed when the trees are closer to maturity.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0167-4366;;WOS:000306585800016;

A system to predict which tree species are likely to be suitable for direct seeding would therefore be useful for improving forest restoration projects. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of seed traits on the success of direct seeding to restore tropical forest in southern Thailand. Seeds of 19 indigenous lowland tropical forest tree species were collected, from both the east and west sides of the Thailand peninsular and the following parameters measured: seed size, shape, coat thickness and moisture content. Field trials were established to determine seed germination rates and to calculate a ""direct seeding suitability score"" for each species, which combined seedling establishment and growth rates. Seed size, shape and moisture content were associated with germination percentage. Species with higher seedling survival tended to have large or intermediate-sized seeds, round or oval seeds and seeds with low or medium moisture content. Only seed coat thickness was significantly correlated with the suitability score (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Seed coat thickness > 0.4 mm coincided with higher rank suitability score. These conditions successfully predicted the success or failure of direct seeding for 15 out of 19 species tested.

Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar.2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types.3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 x 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 x 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35% for seed mass to 77% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity.4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.";;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200007;

Functional traits are posited to explain interspecific differences in performance, but these relationships are difficult to describe for long-lived organisms such as trees, which exhibit strong ontogenetic changes in demographic rates. Here, we use a size-dependent model of tree growth to test the extent to which of 17 functional traits related to leaf and stem economics, adult stature and seed size predict the ontogenetic trajectory of tree growth.2. We used a Bayesian modelling framework to parameterize and contrast three size-dependent diameter growth models using 16 years of census data from 5524 individuals of 50 rain forest tree species: a size-dependent model, a size-dependent model with species-specific parameters and a size-dependent model based on functional traits.3. Most species showed clear hump-shaped ontogenetic growth trajectories and, across species, maximum growth rate varied nearly tenfold, from 0.58 to 5.51 mm year(-1). Most species attained their maximum growth at 60% of their maximum size, whereas the magnitude of ontogenetic changes in growth rate varied widely among species.4. The Trait-Model provided the best compromise between explained variance and model parsimony and needed considerably fewer parameters than the model with species terms.5. Stem economics and adult stature largely explained interspecific differences in growth strategy. Maximum absolute diameter growth rates increased with increasing adult stature and leaf delta(13)C and decreased with increasing wood density. Species with light wood had the greatest potential to modulate their growth, resulting in hump-shaped ontogenetic growth curves. Seed size and leaf economics, generally thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance, had no significant relationships with the growth parameters.6. Synthesis. Our modelling approach offers a promising way to link demographic parameters to their functional determinants and hence to predict growth trajectories in species-rich communities with little parameter inflation, bridging the gap between functional ecology and population demography.;;;;;;;;;24;0;24;0;24;0022-0477;;WOS:000296425000014;

Yet, their impacts on the regeneration dynamics of fragmented forests remain poorly investigated. Here we examine the potential of Atta cephalotes nests to function as ecological filters impacting tree recruitment. Growth, survival and biomass partitioning of experimentally planted seedlings (six tree species) were examined at eight spatially independent A. cephalotes colonies in a large Atlantic Forest fragment. Seedling performance and fate (leaf numbers and damage) were monitored up to 27 months across three habitats (nest centre, nest edge and forest understorey). Plants at illuminated nest centres showed twice the gross leaf gain as understorey individuals. Simultaneously, seedlings of all species lost many more leaves at nests than in the forest understorey, causing a negative net leaf gain. Net leaf gain in the shaded understorey ranged from zero (Licania and Thyrsodium species) to substantial growth for Copaifera and Virola, and intermediate levels little above zero for Protium and Pouteria. Also seedling survival differed across habitats and species, being typically low in the centre and at the edge of nests where seedlings were often completely defoliated by the ants. Lastly, seedling survival increased strongly with seed size at nest edges while there was no such correlation in the forest. Our results suggest that Atta nests operate as ecological filters by creating a specific disturbance regime that differs from other disturbances in tropical forests. Apparently, Atta nests favour large-seeded tree species with resprouting abilities and the potential to profit from a moderate, nestmediated increase in light availability.;;;;;;;;;6;1;6;0;6;1442-9985;;WOS:000296325300004;

We found that the distribution patterns of 25 out of the 31 studied species (80%) were significantly related to mean annual rainfall. Shade tolerance and drought resistance were identified as the main strategy axes of variation. Wood density and leaf deciduousness emerged as the best predictor traits of species position along the rainfall gradient, explaining respectively 32 and 15 percent of the variation. Species traits tended to show stronger relationships with estimated optimum annual rainfall for each species than to the extreme rainfall conditions where they occur.

These data were used to test whether genome size was significantly different for invasive (n = 21; species known to be established and spreading in foreign environments) and non-invasive (n = 71; species that have been introduced to foreign environments but which are not known to be spreading) species. Data for five functional traits [seed mass, specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum height and dispersal mode] and three characteristics of native range (size, temperature range and precipitation range) were used to test for univariate and multivariate relationships between (1) invasiveness and traits and (2) genome size and traits.Results Genome size ranged from 1.20 to 2.13 pg/2C and was not significantly smaller in invasive compared with non-invasive acacias. However, invasive acacias were found to be taller and possess a larger native range size and a wider range of annual precipitation when compared with non-invasive acacias. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between invasive and non-invasive acacias (PERMANOVA; P < 0.01) driven largely by differences in native range characteristics. We detected a positive relationship between genome size and SLA (P = 0.02) and elaiosome dispersal mode (P < 0.01) in analyses across species, but these findings were not supported by evolutionary divergence analyses.Main conclusions Genome size variation does not underpin variation in traits associated with the invasive/non-invasive dichotomy in introduced acacias, probably because of the very small DNA values in the Acacia species studied. Acacias introduced into new environments are most likely to become invasive if they are tall shrubs or trees and are widely distributed in their native range.";;;;;;;;;18;0;18;0;18;1366-9516;;WOS:000294655400009;

However, the ecological responses arising from changes in land use such as traditional and modified shifting cultivation practices are less well known. The distribution and dynamics of plant populations may be affected by such changes in land use and often their responses are compounded by a lack of life history data. The life history traits and demographic parameters important to successional species responses to disturbance remain poorly understood beyond broad generalisations, particularly in rainforests outside of the Neotropics. We examined the life history and demography of five rainforest tree species in Papua New Guinea to investigate the effect of shifting cultivation practices on their population dynamics. The demographic parameters most successful for continued population growth were medium to high recruitment, low seedling mortality and high seedling abundance, relatively low growth rates (compared to many pioneer species) and moderate to high abundance in all life stages. Successful life history traits were high seed mass, moderate shade-tolerance and high cultural value. In accordance with their demographies and life histories, Pterocarpus indicus, Vitex colossus and Artocarpus altilis were classified as early successional species, while Pometia pinnata and Canarium indicum were considered mid-successional. The results suggest that the earlier successional species do not necessarily have an advantage in disturbed environments; persistence is more likely to rely on the response of inherent demographic processes to external influences.

Trees are scarce in these environments but some manage to survive, such as the tree Moringa peregrina. Understanding how trees maintain viable populations in extremely arid environments may provide insight into the adaptive mechanisms by which trees cope with extremely arid weather conditions. This understanding is relevant to the current increasing aridity in several regions of the world.Methods : Seed germination experiments were conducted to assess variation in seed mass, seed germination, and seedling traits of Moringa peregrina plants and the correlations among these traits. A seed burial experiment was also designed to study the fate of M. peregrina seeds buried at two depths in the soil for two time periods.Key results : On average, seeds germinated in three days and seedling shoots grew 0.7 cm per day over three weeks. Larger seeds decreased germination time and increased seedling growth rates relative to smaller seeds. Seeds remained quiescent in the soil and germination was very high at both depths and burial times.Conclusions : The after-ripening time of Moringa peregrina seeds is short and seeds germinate quickly after imbibition. Plants of M. peregrina may increase in hyper-arid environments from seeds with larger mass, shorter germination times, and faster seedling growth rates. The results also illustrate the adjustment in allocation to seed biomass and correlations among seed and seedling traits that allows M. peregrina to be successful in coping with aridity in its environment.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;f_vr-22;;WOS:000291395600021;21653511

The seed mass and composition of seed reserves of 19 co-existing tree species were studied, and we examined how they varied among species in relation to germination and seedling growth rates, as well as between two years with contrasting precipitation (652 and 384 mm).Methods Seeds were collected from a tropical deciduous forest in the northwest of Mexico (Chamela Biological Station). The seed dry mass, with and without the seed coat, and the concentrations of lipids, nitrogen and nonstructural carbohydrates for the seed minus seed coat were determined. The anatomical localization of these reserves was examined using histochemical analysis. The germination capacity, rate and lag time were determined. The correlations among these variables, and their relationship to previously reported seedling relative growth rates, were evaluated with and without phylogenetic consideration.Key Results There were interannual differences in seed mass and reserve composition. Seed was significantly heavier after the drier year in five species. Nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with seed coat fraction, and was significantly higher after the drier year in 12 species. The rate and lag time of germination were negatively correlated with each other. These trait correlations were also supported for phylogenetic independent contrasts. Principal component analysis supported these correlations, and indicated a negative association of seedling relative growth rate with seed size, and a positive association of germination rate with nitrogen and lipid concentrations.Conclusions Nitrogen concentration tended to be higher after the drier year and, while interannual variations in seed size and reserve composition were not sufficient to affect interspecific correlations among seed and seedling traits, some of the reserves were related to germination variables and seedling relative growth rate.;;;;;;;;;9;1;8;2;11;0305-7364;;WOS:000289838700005;21385781

The time during which these reserves are used may vary within species, depending on the availability of external resources. We have investigated the duration of use of the seed reserves in the large-seeded tree species Araucaria angustifolia, when growing under different light and nutrient availabilities. We hypothesised that this duration would not vary with growing conditions, because of the high pressure exerted by predators on these seeds and because of the existing possibility of transferring to and restoring part of their starchy reserves in the underground hypocotyl. Plant growth took place for 139 days under shade cloth in outside gardens, under each of the four combinations of high and low light or nutrient availabilities. Plants within each treatment were separated into six different groups, each including seedlings which were separated from their seeds by cotyledon excision at five different time periods after seed sowing (43, 63, 83, 103 and 124 days), plus a Control group of seedlings which were not deprived from their seeds. Final mass accumulation by seedlings that had full access to the seed reserves was compared with that of seedlings which were separated from their seeds at different time periods after seed sowing. Seed mass evaluations at each excision period allowed us to follow the temporal pattern of seed consumption. We found that seedlings growing under low light used seed reserves for growth longer than those under high light, regardless of their nutrient condition, pointing to the importance of a large seed for seedling establishment under deep shade. However, seed consumption followed a very similar pattern in both light treatments. Nutrient availability did not affect the duration of growth dependency on seed reserves or the pace of seed mass depletion. Our initial hypothesis was then accepted, and the possible implications of the reported early growth behaviour of the species in coping with seed predation and shading are discussed.;;;;;;;;;2;0;3;0;3;0067-1924;;WOS:000287201400005;

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.7. Synthesis. Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000282978100020;

Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;14;0;14;0;14;0021-8901;;WOS:000279405100012;

How do oak species respond along gradients of these factors?LocationMediterranean oak forest in southern Spain.MethodsWe analysed seedling growth components and morphology of three co-occurring Quercus species (two deciduous and one evergreen). Oak seeds with a wide variety of sizes were sown along broad gradients of abiotic conditions. Intra- and inter-specific differences were evaluated by calibrating maximum likelihood estimators of seedling growth during the first two years of life.ResultsWe found multiple resources and conditions affecting seedling morphology and biomass allocation. However, the integrative variables of seedling growth - total aboveground biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) - were affected by two main factors: seed mass and light conditions. The relative contribution of these two factors depended strongly on seedling age. Seed mass explained most of the growth and morphological variables during the first year, while light conditions were the best predictor in the second growing season. In contrast, soil factors did not play an important role in seedling growth. We found some evidence of regeneration niche partitioning between oak species along the light gradient, a reflection of their distribution patterns as adults at the study site.ConclusionsWe conclude that inter-specific differences in seedling growth, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche segregation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;19;1;18;1;21;1100-9233;;WOS:000276656500001;

For saplings, there was no overall significant trend in the frequency, species richness, and Shannon index with respect to distance. Seedlings on the other hand showed a decrease in frequency and species richness with increasing distance from the old growth forest, implying that should recruitment limitation occur in the plantations, it will be stronger at the seed-to-seedling transition than at the seedling-to-sapling transition. Assigning species into groups based on functional traits that are associated with recruitment and regeneration was more revealing. Relative frequency of species that are moderately shade-tolerant, are shrubs, have small seeds, and are frugivore-dispersed increased in the plantations. In comparison, species that are tall trees, have large seeds and are gravity-dispersed decreased in the plantations. Multi-trait analysis showed that propagule size was the trait that could best explain the difference in the distribution of broad-leaf species in the plantations. Based on our results, we suggest to policy-makers that plantation sizes be kept to within a few hundred meters wide, and should ideally be within dispersal distance of species from natural forests that could potentially be seed sources of broad-leaf species. Otherwise, steps must be taken to drive succession such that potentially recruitment-limited species may be able to overcome barriers to regeneration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As such it is contingent on ecological circumstance. The nature of 'this ecological circumstance' is, however, hotly debated. Here, we investigate for angiosperms whether stomatal size may be this 'missing link': the primary determinant of genome size. Stomata are crucial for photosynthesis and their size affects functional efficiency.Methods Stomatal and leaf characteristics were measured for 1442 species from Argentina, Iran, Spain and the UK and, using PCA, some emergent ecological and taxonomic patterns identified. Subsequently, an assessment of the relationship between genome-size values obtained from the Plant DNA C-values database and measurements of stomatal size was carried out.Key Results Stomatal size is an ecologically important attribute. It varies with life-history (woody species, herbaceous species < vernal geophytes) and contributes to ecologically and physiologically important axes of leaf specialization. Moreover, it is positively correlated with genome size across a wide range of major taxa.Conclusions Stomatal size predicts genome size within angiosperms. Correlation is not, however, proof of causality and here our interpretation is hampered by unexpected deficiencies in the scientific literature. Firstly, there are discrepancies between our own observations and established ideas about the ecological significance of stomatal size; very large stomata, theoretically facilitating photosynthesis in deep shade, were, in this study (and in other studies), primarily associated with vernal geophytes of unshaded habitats. Secondly, the lower size limit at which stomata can function efficiently, and the ecological circumstances under which these minute stomata might occur, have not been satisfactorally resolved. Thus, our hypothesis, that the optimization of stomatal size for functional efficiency is a major ecological determinant of genome size, remains unproven.";;;;;;;;;42;6;43;1;49;0305-7364;;WOS:000276544200019;20375204

Thus, examining interspecific differences in carbon allocation patterns is useful when evaluating niche partitioning in forest communities. We hypothesized that shade-tolerant species allocate more carbon to defense and storage and less to growth compared to shade-intolerant species. In gaps and forest understory, we measured relative growth rates (RGR), carbon-based defensive compounds (condensed tannin, total phenolics), and storage compounds (total non-structural carbohydrate; TNC) in seedlings of two tree species differing in shade tolerance. RGR was greater in the shade-intolerant species, Castanea crenata, than in the shade-tolerant species, Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata, in gaps, but did not differ between the species in the forest understory. In contrast, concentrations of condensed tannin and total phenolics were greater in Quercus than in Castanea at both sites. TNC pool sizes did not differ between the species. Condensed tannin concentrations increased with increasing growth rate of structural biomass (GRstr) in Quercus but not in Castanea. TNC pool sizes increased with increasing GRstr in both species, but the rate of increase did not differ between the species. Accordingly, the amount of condensed tannin against TNC pool sizes was usually higher in Quercus than in Castanea. Hence, Quercus preferentially invested more carbon in defense than in storage. Such a large allocation of carbon to defense would be advantageous for a shade-tolerant species, allowing Quercus to persist in the forest understory where damage from herbivores and pathogens is costly. In contrast, the shade-intolerant Castanea preferentially invested more carbon in growth rather than defense (and similar amounts in storage as Quercus), ensuring establishment success in gaps, where severe competition occurs for light among neighboring plants. These contrasting carbon allocation patterns are closely associated with strategies for persistence in these species' respective habitats.";;;;;;;;;18;4;20;0;26;0029-8549;;WOS:000273795200001;19763628

Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a ""fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a ""slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.";;;;;;;;;19;0;17;0;19;d_c-58;;WOS:000268293000014;19739377

Some tree management characteristics, such as plantation density and tree species selection, may help to partially control this competition. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of HP competition on yield and yield components of a soybean intercrop. Soybean was added to a HP-hardwood plantation which was established in 2000 and composed of alternate rows spaced 6 m (field A) and 8 m (field 13) apart. The experimental design permitted the comparison of the combined effects of HP clones (TD-3230, DN-3308, NM-3729J, orientation with respect to HP row (East, West) and distance from the HP row. A thinning was performed at the beginning of 2006 to increase the initial 2 m-spacing between HP within each row to a final 6 m-spacing. Percent total light transmittance (PTLT) was measured from soybean emergence to grain filling (VE-R6). Soil water content (WC) and soil N mineralisation (NMIN) were determined at two different periods corresponding to distinct soybean reproductive stages: (1) from flowering to pod formation (R1-R4) and (2) during grain filling (R5-R6). In 2005, PTLT, soil WC, soil NMIN (for R1-R4), soybean yield and yield components were significantly reduced near the HP row (2 m). The number of pods per m(2) contributed more to the variation in soybean yield than did the 100-seed size, Yield and number of pods per m(2) were highly correlated to PTLT, soil WC (R1-R4) and NMIN (R1-R4). An interaction between clone and orientation was found for field A. On the east side of the HP row, soybean yield with NM-3729 or DN-3308 was significantly higher than that with TD-3230, whereas it did not differ from that with the clone on the west side of the field. In field B, a significant interaction between orientation and distance was observed for PTLT and the number of pods per m(2). PTLT and number of pods per m(2) showed less variability on the west side compared to the east side. In 2006, a more regular PTLT distribution with respect to different orientations and distances from the HP row was observed and compared with that in 2005. Similarly, soil WC, soil NMIN, soybean yield and yield components were more uniform in 2006. These results suggest that HP clone selection, tree spacing within the rows, row spacing, orientation, and silvicultural treatments such as thinning may be useful to control the negative effects of HP competition on the intercrop.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils.We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected.

Since water availability is related to gap size, these differences in microsite preference may reflect in part species-specific differences in germination at reduced water potentials.For 14 neotropical pioneer species, the hypothesis is tested that small-seeded species, with shallow initial rooting depths, reduce the risks associated with desiccation by germinating more slowly and at higher water potentials than large-seeded species.Germination occurred both more quickly and at lower water potentials with increasing seed mass. For example, Ochroma pyramidale (seed mass 5.5 mg) had a time to 50 % germination (T(50)) of 2.8 d and a median base potential for germination (psi(b50)) of -1.8 MPa while Clidemia quinquenervia (seed mass 0.017 mg) had a T(50) of 17.6 d and psi(b50) of -1.1 MPa.These data suggest that small-seeded species germinate only in comparatively moist microsites, such as small canopy gaps, which may reduce the risk of drought-induced mortality. Conversely, large-seeded species are able to germinate in the drier environment of large gaps, where they benefit by enhanced seedling growth in a high irradiance environment. The positive association of seed size and canopy gap size for optimal seedling establishment is maintained by differential germination responses to soil water availability coupled with the scaling of radicle growth rate and seed size, which collectively confer greater drought tolerance on large-seeded species.;;;;;;;;;22;0;20;1;23;0305-7364;;WOS:000260970200007;18840874

Trials were established at three degraded sites previously covered by rainforest, using two different sowing times (the beginning and end of the wet season), and a range of species having different seed sizes and successional status. The results two years after sowing showed that the effects of sowing time on tree seedling establishment were small despite pronounced differences in cumulative rainfall received by the seedlings. Results suggested that at some sites more serious weed competition might be avoided by sowing later in the season. Although some small seeded early successional species could grow quickly, the establishment of these was found to be significantly negatively affected by the growth of weeds, and in most cases, large seeded species showed more consistent establishment. On the other hand the growth rates of larger seeded species were often rather slow, limiting their contribution to early site capture. Results indicate that direct seeding can be a viable establishment method, but the identity of species to be used, the circumstances under which they should be directly sown and the most appropriate timing of sowing will vary with situations. Species characteristics, including seed size, growth rate potential and light requirement will be important to consider in relation to the probable conditions that will develop for seedlings following germination (particularly in relation to plant competition) with or without post-sowing site management, such as removal of weeds.

Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. in both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species. The effect of phylogeny in trait covariation was unimportant, in fact, a mixture of clades was represented in several groups among the species they contained, suggesting among-lineage convergence.

Evidence from five Neotropical forests;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;89;7;;;1908;1920;;10.1890/07-0207.1;;;juil-08;2008;A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests.There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival.Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.;;;;;;;;;124;4;122;0;130;d_c-58;;WOS:000258007500013;18705377

The experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of seed mass and emergence time on the performance of seedlings of Castanopsis chinensis, a large evergreen tree species with limited tolerance of shade. The treatment consisted of three light regimes: 100%, 15% and 2% of full sunlight. Germination rate and germination time showed a significant correlation with seed mass. Germination rate differed among the three light regimes. Early-emerging large-seeded seedlings in 100% light produced the heaviest seedlings, while those resulting from smaller late-emerging seeds and grown under 2% light regime produced the lightest seedlings. Relative growth rate (RGR) decreased with seed mass in all three light regimes, and seedlings of C chinensis have a higher RGR in high and intermediate light levels compared to low light. In contrast, the effect of emergence time on RGR was not significant. The growth of C chinensis seedlings were significantly influenced by seed size, emergence time, and light conditions. For each month, the mean height of seedlings was significantly greatest for large-seeded seedlings and significantly lowest for small-seeded ones, irrespective of emergence time and light conditions. Regeneration success of C chinensis appears to be regulated by the interactive effect of seed mass, emergence time and light regime. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.";;;;;;;;;26;1;24;1;27;1445-4408;;WOS:000259306500007;

Given the reported negative relationship between seed size and RGR, we predicted a negative relationship between seed size and competitive ability among these three species (i.e., D. winteri > P. boldus > P. lingue). Seedlings of D. winteri, the species producing the smallest seeds, had clear and strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of both P. boldus and P. lingue. Likewise, P. boldus, the species producing medium-sized seeds, had strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of the other two species. In addition, negative effects of D. winteri on P. boldus were generally greater than vice versa. Seedlings of P. lingue did not affect the growth of the other two species.

To investigate life-history differentiation and an objective functional classification of tree species we analysed the demography of 29 species in subtropical montane forests in north-western Argentina.2. We computed 13 growth, demographic, abundance and distribution variables based on: (i) two 5-year re-measurements of stems >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) in 8 ha of old growth forest and 4 ha of secondary forest; (ii) assessments of tree crown illumination; and (iii) sapling counts under shade and on landslides.3. We assessed the potential confounding effects of stem size and crown illumination on absolute stem diameter growth rate for the 24 most abundant species. As diameter increased, one species showed significant increases in growth rate and five showed significant reductions. Seventeen species grew significantly faster with increased exposure to light and we controlled for this confounding effect in the computation of diameter growth rates for subsequent analyses.4. A principal component analysis resulted in three meaningful and interpretable axes of demographic variation across species. The first axis (interpreted as shade tolerance) indicates that trees of species with inherently high growth rates tend to have well-exposed crowns at 10-30 cm d.b.h., have high density of trees in secondary forest and are less tolerant of shade.5. The second axis (turnover) shows that in old-growth forest short-lived species, with high mortality rates, size-class distributions with a steep negative slope and low dominance, persist due to high rates of recruitment (to >= 10 cm d.b.h.).The third axis indicates that species that colonize landslides have lower tree recruitment rates and greater growth variability in secondary forest, reflecting spatio/temporal differences in species' recruitment linked to differences in their substrate requirements for regeneration.6. Maximum height and diameter are correlated with the first and second axes, indicating that higher rates of both growth and survival permit some species to attain large size.7. All three demographic axes depict separate trade-offs that confer competitive advantage to each 'demographic type' under contrasting ecological conditions (of light availability, disturbance frequency and disturbance intensity), thus underpinning species' coexistence in dynamic forest landscapes.";;;;;;;;;15;0;15;1;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000250265700007;

We explored the reasons for this pattern by examining the relationship between seed size and CO2 response in Picea abies and P. rubens using growth analysis. The large seeded species (P. abies) responded more positively to elevated CO2 than the small seeded species (P. rubens). At the intraspecific level, P. abies individuals from large seeds responded more positively to elevated CO2 than individuals from small seeds, however, there was no significant intraspecific variation in CO2 response in P. rubens. The greater CO2 response of plants from large seeds was not simply the result of a larger starting capital compounded at the same rate as in plants from small seeds. Elevated CO2 increased relative growth rate to a greater extent in individuals from large seeds. This effect appears to be related to differences in time of establishment, source to sink ratio and nutrient availability with seed size. These results are significant not only in understanding the potential effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant populations, but also in understanding the factors affecting plant success at current atmospheric CO2 levels due to the elevation Of CO2 within the litter layer that occurs at many germination sites.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1435-8603;;WOS:000251545400010;17564949

Resprouting is a key plant attribute facilitating persistence in disturbance-prone environments. Resprouting ability in seedlings may depend on both developmental ontogeny and seed size. However, the relationships between these factors are not well explored, especially for woody species with comparatively small seeds and epigeal germination.2. We investigated resprouting capacity in seedlings from four subtropical, riparian, Myrtaceous tree species, Melaleuca leucadendra, Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa and Tristaniopsis laurina, displaying these characteristics. We recorded resprouting in response to simulated disturbance as a function of seed mass and developmental age (5-150 days post-emergence) and examined the acquisition of resprouting ability in relation to growth and biomass allocation patterns.3. Patterns of resprouting were distinct among species, but the acquisition of resprouting ability was not determined by seed mass. The 'small' seeded M. leucadendra and the 'intermediate' seeded E. camaldulensis showed unexpectedly high shoot resprouting vigour from cotyledon stage (70% resprouting at 5 days post-emergence), as well as greatest ongoing allocation to root mass and lateral root development. In contrast, in A. symphyocarpa (another species with 'intermediate' seed mass) and T. laurina (a 'large' seeded species) resprouting rates during early development were much lower (< 10%), although there was a trend towards increasing resprouting ability with age in A. symphyocarpa (> 150 days). Resprouting capacity was also independent of seedling size and relative growth rate.4. Our results indicate that the size-dependency of resprouting capacity varies considerably among these species. This suggests physiological and morphological species traits other than those directly related to reserve size or relative growth rate may convey survivorship in river environments.5. Our findings show that resprouting capacity was not related to seed size and seedling growth patterns in these four species. This is different to evidence from comparative studies undertaken in fire-prone and other temperate environments. A broader survey of seedling resprouting ability including more species is required to determine the generality of our findings in riparian species.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0022-0477;;WOS:000247320100025;

Roots play a major role in overcoming water stress and plant establishment, thus early root development in response to limited water availability becomes a strategy that may ensure seedling recruitment. We explored whether different water availabilities altered growth patterns of very young seedlings, focussing on root elongation, and hypothesized that seedling responses would depend on species-specific drought tolerance and seed size. We carried out a greenhouse experiment exposing 2-week-old seedlings of three Mediterranean shrubland species, the drought-tolerant and small-seeded Genista umbellata (L'Her.) Dum. Cours. and Lycium intricatum Boiss., and the drought-sensitive, large-seeded Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss., to two watering quantities and monitored plant and root growth weekly in glass cases for 5 weeks. We found that at such early stages, reduced water quantity enhanced root growth in all three species, regardless of drought tolerance and seed size, although root plasticity was the highest in the small-seeded and drought-tolerant Genista. In contrast, shoot elongation and mass allocation, root-to-shoot mass (R:S) ratio, was unaffected by watering. Seedlings responded to lower water availability with faster root elongation rate and greater absorptive root surface, which can account for the enhanced relative growth rate (RGR) of the small-seeded Genista and Lycium under reduced watering. By contrast, a larger root absorptive surface did not lead to higher RGR in the large-seeded Retama probably because of its greater independence from external mineral resources. Our data evidence the importance of water availability on the initial developmental stages of these three species regardless of seed size and drought tolerance. Root growth can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to deal with drying soils and decreasing soil moisture since larger roots enable to exploit unexplored soil areas of soil, which may ensure recruitment success.;;;;;;;;;32;2;31;0;33;0032-079X;;WOS:000247971600010;

The existing studies on the topic suffer from several drawbacks. First, they usually consider only traits related to dispersal ability and not growth. Furthermore, they do not apply phylogenetic corrections, and we thus do not know how considerations of phylogenetic relationships can alter the conclusions. Finally, they usually apply only one technique to calculate habitat isolation, and we do not know how other isolation measures would change the results.We studied the issues using 30 species forming congeneric pairs occurring in fragmented dry grasslands. We measured traits related to dispersal, survival, and growth in the species and recorded distribution of the species in 215 grassland fragments.We show many strong relationships between species traits related to both dispersal and growth and species distribution in the landscape, such as the positive relationship between habitat occupancy and anemochory and negative relationships between habitat occupancy and seed dormancy. The directions of these relationships, however, often change after application of phylogenetic correction. For example, more isolated habitats host species with smaller seeds. After phylogenetic correction, however, they turn out to host species with larger seeds.The conclusions also partly change depending on how we calculate habitat isolation. Specifically, habitat isolation calculated from occupied habitats only has the highest predictive power. This indicates slow dynamics of the species.All the results support the expectation that species traits have a high potential to explain patterns of species distribution in the landscape and that they can be used to build predictive models of species distribution. The specific conclusions are, however, dependent on the technique used, and we should carefully consider this when comparing among different studies. Since different techniques answer slightly different questions, we should attempt to use analyses both with and without phylogenetic correction and explore different isolation measures whenever possible and compare the results.;;;;;;;;;44;0;42;0;44;d_c-58;;WOS:000246104600016;17536712

In temperate forests, however, little support for this hypothesis has been found under field conditions, as compared with shade-house experiments. Performance trade-offs were examined over a large resource gradient in a temperate hardwood forest.Methods The relationship between seedling Survival and seedling relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) was examined at three levels of canopy cover (forest understorey, FU; small gap, SG; and large gap, LG) and at two microsites within each level of canopy cover (presence or absence of leaf litter) for five deciduous broad-leaved tree species with different seed sizes.Key Results Within each species, both RCRm(M) and RGR(H) usually increased with increasing light levels (in the order FU < SG < LG), whereas little difference was observed based on the presence or absence of litter. Seedling survival in FU was negatively correlated with both RGR(M) and RCRH in both LG and SG. The trade-off between high-light growth and low-light survival was more evident in the relationship with LG as compared with SG. An intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR was observed along environmental gradients in Acer mono, whereas seedlings of Betula platyphylla var. japonica survived and grew better in LG.Conclusions The results presented here strongly support the idea of light gradient partitioning (i.e. species coexistence) in spatially heterogeneous light environments in temperate forests, and that further species diversity would be promoted by increased spatial heterogeneity. The intraspecific trade-off between survival and RGR in Acer suggests that it has broad habitat requirements, whereas Betula has narrow habitat requirements and specializes in high-light environments.";;;;;;;;;30;0;30;0;32;0305-7364;;WOS:000245176800013;17242042

We present the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, using seven woody neotropical species.We transplanted seedlings that had recently expanded their first photosynthetic cotyledon or leaf to the forest understorey (1% of full sun) and quantified initial biomass and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) in stems, roots and storage cotyledons. We then randomly assigned seedlings to control and two stress treatments: light reduction (0.08% of full sun for 8 weeks) and complete defoliation.First-year survival of control seedlings, a comparative measure of shade tolerance, differed widely among species. The two stress treatments reduced survival and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species. Shade-tolerant species were little impacted by the stress treatments, whereas the two least shade-tolerant species experienced 100% mortality.In all treatments, 8-week and first-year survival was positively correlated with initial TNC pool size in stems and roots. By contrast, survival was generally not correlated with initial TNC concentration in any organ, TNC pools in cotyledons, seed mass or seedling biomass.TNC in stems and roots, but not in cotyledons, decreased in response to light reduction and defoliation over 8 weeks. Leaf area recovery of defoliated seedlings was positively correlated with initial TNC pools in stems and roots.First-year survival in each treatment was negatively correlated with 0-8 week RGR of control seedlings, suggesting higher stress tolerance of species with inherently slow growth rates in shade. RGR of control seedlings from 0 to 8 weeks was negatively correlated with initial TNC pools, but not concentrations, in stems and roots. After 8 weeks, RGR was positive for all species, without clear relationships with survival or TNC.We conclude that carbohydrate storage in stems and roots enhances long-term survival in shade by enabling seedlings to cope with periods of biotic and abiotic stress. Carbohydrate storage is a key functional trait that can explain species differences in growth and survival that lead to species coexistence through niche assembly processes and life-history trade-offs.;;;;;;;;;91;12;96;3;108;0022-0477;;WOS:000244114400018;

First the means by which seed images are acquired and processed shall be reviewed, to account how imaging technology analysis has been developed in the last two decades. Automated recording of seed size, shape, and colour data to assess germination and vigour can improve those obtained by traditional tests. The aspect of automated image analysis potential to identify and characterise cultivars and weed seeds on the basis of differences in seed morphology is in line with the development of new non-invasive methods in seed sorting. This topic includes also X-ray imaging technique application, which allows correlations between different seed morphological categories and viability in economically important tree and crop species. Some reference are also made to the recent application of computer tomography to the study of internal morphology and function in seeds. The future perspectives focus on the interest of seed researcher and analysts in introducing a computer vision system in a seed laboratory to integrate data obtained by human visual inspection in seed processing and management. The ultimate goal should be to create extensive databases where matching of different bio-morphological traits of a large number of seed species may be performed for purity analysis, taxonomy screening and viability and vigour prediction. Combining digital imaging with genomics and proteomics, traits of economically important crop plants might be characterized more accurately, and, so, a new 'holistic vision' of the form and function could be provided to the study of seed biology.;;;;;;;;;12;0;9;1;12;0251-0952;;WOS:000251624700001;

This study investigated how we could benefit by careful seed selection prior to any regeneration attempts. The effects of seed size and parent tree were evaluated on seed variables and seedling growth. One subset of seeds was used to evaluate seed variables (e.g. moisture content), and another subset was used to characterize seedling growth (e.g. root width). Both seed size and parent tree had an effect on the majority of seed variables and seedling growth, with larger seeds performing better. Our results confirm that careful selection of seed size (specifically larger sizes) and parent tree of these high-valued species gives rise to more vigorous seedlings that could increase regeneration success. Nursery practices could also benefit by reducing production cost when regenerating a site by seeds as opposed to transplanting seedlings.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0251-0952;;WOS:000251624700026;

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-301% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.;;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;0266-4674;;WOS:000242132900005;

Using mandibles as tools, they have to perforate the seed shell to reach the nutritious interior. The isometric growth of larval mandibles, known from predatory species, would result in a changing ratio between seed and mandible size during the course of development. The stable size of host tree seeds should select an optimum mandible size, similar for the three larval instars in spermophageous species. We found an increasing tendency to maintain the length of the apical mandible part (apex) in seed feeding species. The size increase is higher in the species from Australia, Africa and South East Asia than in the New World species of the genus Notiobia. Feeding experiments have revealed that larvae of species with a stronger increase in apex growth are also able to develop as predators of Drosophila larvae. Our results furthermore point to an influence of beetle size and shell hardness of the host tree seeds on the apex size and its growth rate.;;;;;12th European Carabidologists Meeting (ECM XII);SEP 19-22, 2005;;Murcia, SPAIN;3;0;4;0;4;0785-8760;;WOS:000241842800017;

This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (M-A), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny.Light vs. M-A relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower M-A than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to M-A increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR.The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species' successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.;;;;;;;;;70;6;67;1;77;0022-0477;;WOS:000235332300019;

However, recent studies suggest that both the occurrence of AMF on rain forest plants and the dependence of rain forest plants on AMF can be highly variable. We examined the occurrence and levels of AMF colonization of some common seedling species in a tropical and a subtropical rain forest site in Queensland, Australia. We also used a long-term database to compare the growth and mortality rates of seedling species that rarely formed AMF with those that regularly formed AMF. In both forests, more than one-third of the seedling species rarely formed AMF associations, while 40% of species consistently formed AMF in the tropical site compared to 27% in the subtropical site. Consistent patterns of AMF occurrence were observed among plant families at the two sites. Variation among seedling species in AMF occurrence or colonization was not associated with differences in seed mass among species, variation in seedling size and putative age within a species, or lack of AMF inoculum in the soil. Comparisons of four seedling species growing both in the shaded understory and in small canopy gaps revealed an increase in AMF colonization in two of the four species in gaps, suggesting that light limitation partially explains the low occurrence of AMF. Seedling survival was significantly positively associated with seed biomass but not with AMF colonization. Furthermore, seedling species that regularly formed AMF and those that did not had similar rates of growth and survival, suggesting that mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal strategies were equivalent in these forests. Furthermore, the high numbers of seedlings that lacked AMF and the overall low rate of seedling growth (the average seedling required 6 years to double its height) suggest that most seedlings did not receive significant indirect benefits from AMF through connection to canopy trees via a common mycorrhizal network.;;;;;;;;;12;1;14;0;14;0940-6360;;WOS:000235717000003;16133252

Are there competitive response strategies for light in juvenile plants? 2. If so, do plant traits (e.g. seed weight, relative growth rate, height and biomass) correlate with the strategies?Location: Controlled greenhouse study using perennial vegetation typical of wet meadows in Northeast Ohio, USA.Methods: We used two light manipulations in a greenhouse to screen ten replicates of 19 plant species for three proposed competitive response strategies ('escape', 'forage', 'persist'). We measured the time it took a seedling to die and the maximum height achieved when grown in the dark to assess two strategies, persist and escape. The biomass of seedlings when grown under a controlled, low-intensity, shifting light source was measured to test a third strategy, forage.Results: We found significant variation across species in the measurements used to assess each strategy. The species ranking for each strategy was not concordant across strategies. Traits were found that correlated with the escape strategy (seed weight, height and biomass) and persist strategy (time to reach maximum height). No traits were found that correlate with the forage strategy.Conclusions: There appear to be trade-offs by plants in the three strategies tested in this study. Species which had the best performance on one strategy typically scored poorly on the other strategies. However, many species fall in the middle range, ranking similarly across the 'persist', 'escape', and 'forage' strategies.;;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;1100-9233;;WOS:000235669200003;

Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species.4 Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly.5 We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment.6 Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.;;;;;;;;;53;8;54;0;64;0022-0477;;WOS:000233287500012;

Seedlings were grown in eight microhabitat types composed of paired gap and shaded understory sites in each of four soil types. We defined performance trade-offs relevant to coexistence as significant pairwise rank reversals for species performance between contrasting situations, of which we characterize three types: microhabitat, fitness component, and ontogenetic. Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps). Third, the most frequent rank reversals between species pairs occurred between early and later ontogenetic stages, especially between fitness components in contrasting microhabitats. Overall, 15 of 36 pairs of potentially competing species exhibited some type of seedling performance trade-off, two species pairs never outperformed one another, and for 19 species pairs one species was a consistent better performer.

In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGIR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;21;1435-8603;;WOS:000232416400006;16163613

Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1 - 1.5m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis ( PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size.Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size.Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.;;;;;;;;;12;0;12;0;12;0305-7364;;WOS:000230724400015;15944175

Experimental field data and interspecific comparative analyses were used to detect effects of seed mass on seedling performance within and among seven species of Psychotria sown in gaps and shaded rainforest sites. In addition we compared the effects of seed mass within and among species to detect concordance between the two ecological scales. We used two comparative methods: phylogenetically independent contrasts and cross-species correlations.2. Among species, we detected weak evidence of a positive correlation between seed mass and the probability of emergence in the shaded forest, and no effects of seed mass in gaps.3. Among species, no significant correlations between seed mass and either seedling survival or seedling recruitment were found in any habitat. Other variables specific to each subgenus appear to be more important than seed mass in determining survival in the shaded forest.4. There was a negative correlation between seed mass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both habitats. In gaps, small-seeded taxa exhibited particularly high RGR, compensating for the initial advantages of higher seed mass.5. All species studied exhibited recruitment in gaps equal to or higher than that in the shaded forest. However, recruitment success in shaded forest relative to gaps increased with seed mass, indicating a higher affinity for shaded forest among larger-seeded taxa, but this relationship was only detected using PICS analysis.6. Correlations between seed mass and seedling mass are similar within and among species, indicating a simple principle of mass transference. In contrast, correlations between seed mass and seedling emergence, seedling survival, seedling recruitment and RGR depend on the scale at which they are observed.;;;;;;;;;11;5;12;0;17;0269-8463;;WOS:000231397300020;

During the fall season, data were collected on the numbers of cones per tagged tree, as well as seed counts, their mass, and seed set following dehiscence. Dbh was measured for individual trees during each spring. Overall, 80.3% of the trees produced seed cones in even-numbered years compared with 51.6% in odd-numbered years. Moreover, trees that matured seed cones in even years produced 12 times more seeds per tree than those in odd years. Tree diameters generally increased significantly during the summers after odd-numbered years, although the trees at one site showed a consistent growth rate each year after 2000. Annual variations in individual seed mass, seed set, and the proportion of damaged seed cones occurred largely within odd or even years. Based on these results the following conclusions were made: 1) seed-cone production of P densiflora is somewhat synchronized, but is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, 2) P densiflora tends to undergo mast seeding at two-year intervals, and 3) this alternate-year excess in seed crop may have evolved to increase fitness, though the exact evolutionary mechanism is unclear.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;1226-9239;;WOS:000230506100002;

Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance.2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass.3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient.4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient.5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies.;;;;;;;;;85;1;79;1;86;0022-0477;;WOS:000229283000006;

In this Study, we assessed the differences in relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA), and survival of seedlings of the tree species Drimys winteri (Winteraceae) and Gevuina avellano (Proteaceae) planted in three forest habitats differing in light availability: (1) forest interior, (2) forest edge, and (3) tree-fall gap (1%, 6%, and 12% of canopy openness, respectively). A total of 60 3-month-old seedlings of each species were monitored over 16 months (December 2001-April 2003) in the three habitats of a Valdivian rainforest fragment on Chiloe Island. southern Chile. RGR was greatest in the tree-fall gap in both species. Allocation to leaves was proportionally higher in the forest interior. SLA tended to be lower in the tree-fall gap, intermediate in the forest edge, and greater in the forest interior in both species. In addition, SLA of D. winteri seedlings was always greater than that of G. avellana in all three habitats. Survival of both species was greatest Survival of seedlings of the larger-seeded species, G. avellana, was greatest during the first few months of the experiment in the forest interior, but then dropped significantly in the period during which seedlings of the smaller-seeded species, D. winteri, survived in greater numbers. Our comparative study of two intermediate-shade-tolerant tree species documented wide variation in growth and survival of seedlings among habitats differing in canopy openness.;;;;;;;;;7;0;8;0;8;0028-825X;;WOS:000229011100003;

The seeds differed one order of magnitude in their total volume. However, independently of their size and the location of the maternal tree, the relationship between the volume occupied by dispersal and establishment structures was relatively constant (similar to 1) and showed a normal distribution with low skewness, indicating stabilizing selection. These results Suggest that, in the habitats studied, dispersal and establishment processes may have similar importance to C. angustifolia. In species with seeds confined in pods, and therefore strongly space-limited, the relative volume of their seeds occupied by dispersal and establishment structures could be a better measure of the trade-off between these two processes than the variation in seed size.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;1;1;0034-7744;;WOS:000232593200007;17354420

A combination of field and controlled experiments was used on seeds and seedlings of these congeners to determine species characteristics that may be contributing to these floristic changes. Acer platanoides experienced lower rates of seed predation than A. saccharum in field experiments. Differences in the dispersal and allocation characteristics of the two species were small and not likely to explain the relative success of A. platanoides. Greenhouse-grown seedlings of A. platanoides were much larger than those of A. saccharum because of differences in seed size, not differences in growth rate. These data suggest that preferential seed predation and initial seed size differences may explain greater relative success in Acer platanoides seedlings.;;;;;;;;;10;0;10;0;11;1092-6194;;WOS:000228492500003;

This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.;;;;;;;;;42;6;41;3;49;0029-8549;;WOS:000226357400005;15503163

Wide variation in initial spatial patterns of natural regeneration of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) between managed and undisturbed white pine forests of the Great Lakes region of North America has been attributed to differences in understory light levels and the frequency of substrates suitable for germination and seedling establishment. To explore the potential influence of seed mass on these observed patterns, the interaction of seed mass and light on early growth of white pine was investigated in a greenhouse study. Seedlings of five half-sib families differing in mean seed mass were grown for 8 and 14 weeks under moderate and low light conditions representing managed and undisturbed pine stands, respectively. Family differences in seedling biomass and root system development under each light environment were associated with positive, linear relationships with mean seed mass. Family and seed mass had a comparatively weak influence on biomass partitioning and relative growth rate. Moderate light improved seedling growth regardless of seed mass, but relative expression of seed mass effects on seedling traits was unaffected by light environment. These results suggest differential recruitment of white pine in managed and undisturbed stands is unrelated to variation in seed mass.;;;;;;;;;8;1;6;1;9;ao_t-26;;WOS:000226031700011;

Comparisons among closely related species should reveal adaptive differentiation in species characteristics that are consistent with their differences in geographic distribution. This expectation was tested by comparing characteristics of seedlings of spruce species in relation to environmental factors representative of their current natural ranges.Methods Seedlings were grown from a total of 34 Populations representing eight North American spruce (Picea) species in a controlled environment chamber for 140 d. Traits related to the potential of seedling establishment, including tolerance to stress events (high temperature, desiccation) were evaluated. Correlations were sought between these characteristics and modal values of latitude, aridity and continentality in the geographic range of each species.Key Results Many seedling traits changed significantly in response to stress events, but Only the response of chlorophyll concentration differed significantly among species. Components of seedling growth were good correlates of species distribution. Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with latitude, and leaf weight ratio (LWR) negatively correlated with aridity. Seed mass was negatively correlated with latitude.Conclusions Relationships found between seedling traits and geographical variation in environmental conditions suggest that factors such as temperature regime, water availability and perhaps litter depth affect species range in North American spruces. Seedling characteristics appear to be elements in a reasonably distinct environmental niche for each spruce species at the continental scale.

One proposed mechanism by which tree species coexist is through partitioning gradients of light availability. We performed a pot experiment in which seedlings of 12 pioneer species were established in 30% light, then transplanted to six light treatments designed to simulate natural gaps ranging from 25 m(2) (approximate to10% full sun) to 800 m(2) (60% full sun). Plants were harvested after 56-117 days, and comparisons were made of allocation patterns and growth and carbon assimilation rates.2. Species varied strongly in their maximum relative growth rate (RGR, range 15.4-83.6 mg g(-1) day(-1)). However, we found little evidence for gap-size partitioning based on growth rate, as species RGR in large and small simulated gaps was strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P < 0.001).3. Species differences in growth reflected variation in both physiology and allocation. Net assimilation rate was a strong determinant of RGR across all simulated gap sizes (r(2) = 0.60-0.71, P < 0.001). Leaf area ratio was a poor predictor of growth rate under all gap sizes (r(2) = 0.04-0.08, NS).4. The maximum rate of net C assimilation (A(max)) increased significantly with simulated gap size for all but one pioneer species, but only when measured on a per area basis. Among species variation in A(max) was only weakly related to RGR. Foliar nitrogen concentration varied widely among species (range 2.2-4.7% dry mass), but was only weakly correlated with RGR (r(2) = 0.04-0.30).5. Previous growth analyses of tropical seedlings have identified both specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass as key traits correlated with growth rate. Although SLA varied twofold and seed mass more than a thousand-fold among the pioneer species in this study, neither trait was significantly correlated with among-species variation in RGR. Although these traits underlie major differences in life history between shade-tolerant and pioneer species, they contribute little to variation in growth performance within the pioneer functional group.;;;;;;;;;30;1;31;0;32;0269-8463;;WOS:000224000900014;

However, inherent trade-offs between shade tolerance and drought tolerance, as hypothesized in the literature, would constrain potential niche differentiation. For thirteen species of European trees and shrubs the impacts were determined of moderate and extreme drought on the growth and survival of first-year seedlings in a given soil volume, in irradiances in the range typical for temperate forest and scrub understories (3% daylight) and large gaps (30% daylight). Pots were watered differentially each second day to equalize soil water content across species and irradiances. Comparisons within and across species supported independent tolerances of shade and drought rather than trade-offs. For all species, drought reduced relative growth rate in dry mass by the same proportion in 3% daylight and in 30% daylight. Consequently, drought generally reduced final dry mass significantly more strongly in 30% daylight than in 3% daylight. Extreme drought led to earlier mortality in 30% daylight than in 3% daylight for nine of the eleven species tested, to earlier mortality in 3% daylight for one species, and to equal mortality rate in both irradiances for one species. For each species, growth-based shade tolerance was quantified as the ratio of absolute growth in low irradiance to that in high irradiance, and growth-based drought tolerance as the ratio of absolute growth in low water supply to that in high water supply. Across species, growth-based shade tolerance varied approximate to9-fold, and growth-based drought tolerance approximate to2-fold; species' tolerances correlated respectively with indices of field establishment in shade and drought. Growth-based drought tolerance correlated with survival time in extreme drought. Experimentally quantified shade and drought tolerances varied independently for the 13 species tested, indicating the potential for extensive species niche differentiation in combinations of irradiance and water supply.";;;;;;;;;78;1;72;2;80;0030-1299;;WOS:000223821600010;

Surprisingly, we found no relationship between seed mass and seedling establishment (P = 0.21).

Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica, Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula. Germination tests were conducted under five osmotic potential levels. Seedlings from large (LS) and small (SS) seeds were grown at four soil moisture levels. Observations were made on height, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits such as relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Seeds of pioneer species and large seeds, within species, germinated earlier, and with increasing water stress, per cent germination and germination velocity declined. RGR was inversely related with drought tolerance. R:S ratio increased, RGR and SLA declined, but NAR increased with water stress. Notwithstanding successional status, the slow-growing species registered minimum reduction in biomass due to water stress. The response of LS and SS seedlings also differed for some of the growth variables. Increase in NAR could be a compensatory response to water stress, and the marked allocational plasticity could help maximize capture of the limited resource. Seedlings from smaller seeds, particularly of fast-growing species, would be able to cope with mild drought by morphogenetic and physiological plastic response in a better way than those from large seeds. However, seedlings from large seeds had greater survival than those from smaller seeds under intense water stress.;;;;;;;;;28;1;28;0;30;0266-4674;;WOS:000222985200004;

Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment.2. We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species).3. Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1).4. Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1) if mortality continued at the same rate for some time.5. The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle. One possibility is that the greater seed production of small-seeded species (m(-2) of canopy outline year(-1)) is partly offset by larger canopies and longer reproductive life spans in large-seeded species.;;;;;;;;;262;15;265;2;286;0022-0477;;WOS:000221424600001;

The seedlings of larger seeded species generally perform better than those of smaller seeded species under a variety of hazards. The reserve effect proposes that larger seeded species retain a greater proportion of their initial seed resources and their seedlings are therefore better provisioned to cope with post-deployment resource deficits.2. This hypothesis was tested with a suite of 32 Australian rain forest species with storage cotyledons, and seed reserve mass ranging from 36 mg to 25 g. Seedlings germinated in dim light were harvested as their first set of leaves became fully expanded, dissected into shoot, root and left-over cotyledons, dried and weighed.3. In cross-species, allometric analyses, the mean mass of the shoot-plus-root scaled less than proportionately (slope c. 0.8), and mean cotyledon mass more than proportionately (slope c. 1.1) with either initial seed mass or seedling mass. These slopes were significantly different from each other. Both conditions for a reserve effect were therefore fulfilled. Cotyledons ranged from 45% of total seedling mass in the smallest species, to 92% in the largest.4. Solid evidence for a reserve effect was detected within two of four families tested (Lauraceae and Myrtaceae), but only in 7 of the 22 species for which there were sufficient data.5. Even if the reserve effect has present day utility for enhanced seedling performance in larger seeded species, it may have evolved in response to selection for a greater relative retention of initial seed mass during seedling deployment in larger seeded species, combined with selection for greater deployment of seed reserves to the initial shoot and root of smaller seeded species.;;;;;;;;;25;3;24;1;29;0022-0477;;WOS:000221424600003;

Seedlings from large (LS) and small seeds ( SS) were grown at two CO2 levels ( ambient and elevated, 700 - 750 ppm). CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and foliar N were determined after 30 d exposure to elevated CO2. Seedlings were harvested after 30 d and 60 d exposure periods. Height, diameter, leaf area, biomass and other growth traits (RGR, NAR, SLA, R: S) were determined. Seedling biomass across species was positively related with seed mass. Within species, LS seedlings exhibited greater biomass than SS seedlings. Elevated CO2 enhanced plant biomass for all the species. The relative growth rate ( RGR), net assimilation rate ( NAR), CO2 assimilation rate, R: S ratio and water use efficiency increased under elevated CO2. However, the positive impact of elevated CO2 was down regulated beyond 30 d exposure. Specific leaf area ( SLA), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance declined due to exposure to elevated CO2. Fast growing, early successional species exhibited greater RGR, NAR and CO2 assimilation rate. Per cent enhancement in such traits was greater for slow growing species. The responses of individual species did not follow functional types (viz. legumes, non-legumes). The enhancement in biomass and RGR was greater for large-seeded species and LS seedlings within species.

We tested the hypothesis that the type of microhabitat suitable for O. europaea recruitment is influenced by microhabitat-specific relationships between seed size and seedling growth rate. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments evaluating seedling growth and survival as a function of seed size, microhabitat (determined by presence/absence of scrub cover), and competition (established by means of seedling density gradients). Our results show that, first, seed size was related to seedling size and to differential growth rate. Second, seedling growth rate was negatively correlated with initial seedling size, although this correlation varied among microhabitats and temporally. Third, seedling survival differed between microhabitats and was positively affected by initial seedling size until the end of the summer drought. Finally, the effect of seedling size on survival was partly mediated by its negative relationship with growth rate. However, the combined effect of size and growth on seedling survival varied between microhabitats. We conclude that establishment depended on microbabitats through facilitation and inhibition processes, and that seed size-related growth rate strongly affected seedling fate.

However, there were clear differences in allocation patterns and in phenotypic responses to light intensity. Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA).4 Savanna species also exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and net assimilation rate in response to light intensity. An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs. Many of these traits were correlated to seed mass, which is itself highly conserved within genera.;;;;;;;;;82;0;87;18;94;0022-0477;;WOS:000183144700014;

Fertilization effects on biomass accumulation, relative growth rate and tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were examined for seedlings grown under relatively high light. Higher light conditions in gaps are expected as human disturbance expands in tropical landscapes. Two questions were asked: (1) Does nutrient addition enhance growth or result in nutrient accumulation in the tissues of tropical tree seedlings grown in pots under high light? (2) Are these responses conditional on their adaptations to light availability, seed mass or growth form? Most of the species (73% of light-demanding and 60% of shade-tolerant) demonstrated a positive growth response to fertilization. The magnitude of the response of light-demanding species was more than twice that of shade-tolerant species. A higher proportion of shade-tolerant species accumulated nutrients in their tissues (up to 95% for P), but over half the light-demanding species did so as well. For both types of species, a higher percentage accumulated P than N. Responses in growth and in P accumulation were negatively correlated with seed mass. Shrubs responded more than trees in biomass accumulation, but there was a trend toward greater response by trees in relative growth rate and N and P accumulation. The results suggest that variation in nutrient availability could affect the structure of tropical forests regenerating from large-scale disturbance. In fertile sites, competitive exclusion may occur within the light-demanding species, resulting in a decline in local tree diversity. Depending on the effects of human disturbance on nutrient availability, loss of tree diversity at a local scale may compound diversity loss due to habitat destruction at the landscape scale.;;;;;;;;;33;0;33;2;36;0266-4674;;WOS:000183658600003;

Using a combination of field sampling and shadehouse experiments, we investigated the influence of propagule size and predispersal insect damage on the establishment and early growth of the three common mangrove species on the Caribbean coast of Panama: Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle. In our field samples, all three species exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in mature propagule size, and suffered moderate to high levels of predispersal attack by larval insects. Rates of insect attack were largely independent of propagule size both within and among trees. Our experimental studies using undamaged mature propagules showed that, for all three species, seedlings established at high rates regardless of propagule size. However, propagule size did have a marked effect on early seedling growth: seedlings that developed from larger propagules grew more rapidly. Predispersal insect infestations that had destroyed or removed a substantial amount of tissue, particularly if that tissue was meristematic or conductive, reduced the establishment of propagules of all three species. The effect of sublethal tissue damage or loss on the subsequent growth of established seedlings varied among the three mangrove species. For Avicennia, the growth response was graded: for a propagule of a given size, the more tissue lost, the slower the growth of the seedling. For Laguncularia, the response to insect attack appeared to be all-or-none. If the boring insect penetrated the outer spongy seed coat and reached the developing embryo, it usually caused sufficient damage to prevent a seedling from developing. On the other hand, if the insect damaged but did not penetrate the seed coat, a completely healthy seedling developed and its growth rate was indistinguishable from a seedling developing from an undamaged propagule of the same size. Similar to Avicennia, if an infestation did not completely girdle a Rhizophora seedling, it survived, but grew at a reduced rate. In summary, our experiments demonstrated that natural levels of variation in propagule size and predispersal damage by insects translate into significant differences in seedling performance in terms of establishment and/or early growth.-Such differences are sufficiently large that they could influence the intensity and outcome of competitive interactions during forest regeneration.;;;;;;;;;24;2;24;0;27;0029-8549;;WOS:000183722700010;12684857

We assessed the role of relative growth rate (RGR), life form, seed and fruit mass as potential constraints of plant phenology. In a comparison of traits of 22 Mediterranean woody plant species, the duration of the primary shoot growing period decreased from climbers to shrubs and to trees. A hypothesised negative association between RGR and primary shoot growth duration did not emerge in our species set. The mechanism underlying phenological differences between plant life forms might relate to differences in the proportion of respiring to photosynthetic tissues, which decreases from climbers to trees. It is suggested that the degree of shoot preformation within the bud correlates with primary shoot growth duration, but not with RGR. Development of big fruits and seeds competes for carbon with vegetative growth. Indeed, species with bigger seeds and fruits exhibited shorter primary shoot growing periods, which tended to overlap with flower bud formation and flowering periods. We suggest that duration of primary shoot growth allow to short out the species between two extreme growth strategies: The conservative one would be characterised by a concentration of the primary shoot growth into a short period, free of frosts and droughts, and by a diversion of part of the current resources to assure next year's growth. The opportunistic strategy, on the other extreme, would be defined by the allocation of resources to current growth whenever they are available, achieving longer growing periods at the expense of higher risk of tissue damage. These strategies should have been selected for in environments of predictable and unpredictable resource availability, respectively.;;;;;;;;;26;0;26;1;28;1385-0237;;WOS:000182132400010;

Shadehouse effects were investigated by examining the seedling growth and morphological properties of four shade-tolerant tree species from north-east Queensland in the forest and in neutral-density shadehouses for up to 1 y. Understorey plots were compared with 0.8% shadehouses, and single-treefall gaps were compared with 10% shadehouses. Seedlings of all species showed higher growth rates in the shadehouses compared with the equivalent forest treatments. Nonetheless, trends found between high- and low-light growth rates in the shadehouse seedlings were mirrored in forest-grown seedlings. Specific leaf area (SLA) values in the shadehouses provided a good approximation of SLA in the forest for species in both light treatments. In contrast, biomass allocation and leaf area ratios were only comparable for forest and shadehouse seedlings grown in the high-light treatment. Furthermore. seedlings grown in shadehouses differed significantly from forest-grown seedlings in terms of their root morphology. Despite the differences in absolute values of plant characters in the shadehouse and forest seedlings, 65% of significant differences detected between high- and low-light plant characters in shadehouse-grown seedlings were also found in the forest-grown plants.;;;;;;;;;13;8;14;1;25;0266-4674;;WOS:000182606600005;

We explored these hypotheses using experimental studies in both field and controlled conditions. Our experiments examined intraspecific effects of seed mass on seedling demography in eight sympatric woody species of Psychotria. We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.;;;;;;;;;47;5;50;3;56;d_c-58;;WOS:000181482600017;

We examined patterns of growth and mortality among shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and survival rates across species.2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight.3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2% daylight showed no significant relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR(M) ) in 0.8% and 10% light.4 The RGR(M) values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR(M) was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR(M) was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass).5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have important implications for the coexistence of shade-tolerant tropical tree species.;;;;;;;;;52;4;55;1;61;0022-0477;;WOS:000180744300008;

Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N-2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competition - the CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.;;;;;;;;;241;5;217;2;262;0028-646X;;WOS:000180609700002;

Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg. Screening of species for seed mass and SLA should help predict their germination and establishment success or failure in milled peatlands and allow more directed interventions to favour the establishment of desirable species in milled bogs.;;;;;;;;;15;4;17;0;22;1385-0237;;WOS:000186132100007;

To determine the effects of above- and belowground constraints on tree seedling germination, survival, and growth, we used four mowing and shading treatments of the Saccharum. Shading the Saccharum effectively eliminated it, whereas mowing led to increased light aboveground, but did not reduce Saccharum growth rate. Germination, survival, and growth of tree seedlings approximately doubled in shade treatments compared to the unshaded control, but were lowest when the Saccharum was mowed three times. Fire significantly decreased germination and survival.Some species did not follow these general trends, however: we identified four species groups that varied in their response to Saccharum competition. Very small-seeded, light-demanding species performed poorly, and we do not recommend their use in reforestation because they tolerate neither above- nor belowground constraints imposed by the Saccharum.

A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey).2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mm N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth.3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun.4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia , the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen.5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea , the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade.6.

We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama.2 To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design.3 Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots.4 We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season.5 In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.6 We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence-establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.;;;;;;;;;160;17;168;10;193;0022-0477;;WOS:000175666900013;

Previous studies on the combined effects of light and nutrient supply on the growth rates of plants have involved adding nutrients to soils to levels rarely (or never) met by the plants in nature. As a better test of the likely response of plants to root competition for nutrients. we grew for 1 year seedlings of six species of Australian rainforest tree on forest topsoil undiluted and on soil diluted 50/50, 25/75 and 5/95 with coarse sand. Seedlings were grown in tall tubes in 6 and 9% daylight, equivalent to gap-edge and gap-centre conditions.2. The six species varied in their light requirements for establishment and onward growth.3. One species grew significantly and markedly more quickly on soil diluted 50/50 with sand (Elaeocarpus grandis). Improved aeration is the most likely explanation.4. The extent of inhibition by soil dilution correlated positively with the absolute amount of new dry mass accreted in one year, whether the larger accretion resulted from a combination of high relative growth rate (RGR) and small embryo size, or moderate RGR and larger embryo size.5. Soil dilution generally reduced leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio, but had no significant effect on specific leaf area.6. In all species the overall concentration of nitrogen in the whole plant declined with soil dilution, in the four species tested, N concentration in leaves declined, and it is likely that the reduction in growth arose partly from a reduced unit leaf rate. Most species showed increases in the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg with soil dilution, or no change, but in Diploglottis bracteata the concentrations of Ca and Mg, especially in the older leaves, declined markedly with soil dilution, and one of these cations could have been limiting growth.7. Extrapolation of the results to the field suggests that in single-treefall gaps the fastest growing species will the most inhibited by root competition.8. The soil-dilution technique is likely to be more appropriate than nutrient addition as an indicator of sensitivity to root competition on a given soil.;;;;;;;;;8;0;8;0;9;0269-8463;;WOS:000175467600009;

Therefore, we examined the effects of both family identity and simulated acid rain on Pinus densiflora seedlings over a 34-week period, beginning at germination. We were able to evaluate the importance of family and pH treatment independent of seed mass and germination date by considering the latter two variables as covariates. Seeds were collected from six randomly chosen trees that were assumed to represent different genotypes. After germination in a controlled environment, the seedlings were moved outdoors. Each was then subjected twice a week to 40 mL of simulated acid rain, at a pH of either 3.0 or 5.6. We examined variations in germination date, seedling height, needle numbers and lengths, and root and shoot masses. The maternal family effect was significant for all characters over the entire test period. Strong effects of pH treatment were detected only at the later growth stages. Artificial rain with a pH of 3.0 enhanced growth rates, particularly aboveground, compared with seedlings treated with pH 5.6 rain. However, regardless of pH, certain groups of maternal siblings consistently performed better in almost all parameters. The exception was for mean germination date, which differed among families only at a pH of 3.0. Therefore, although we demonstrated that acid rain affected both the date of germination as well as seedling growth rates in P. densiflora, the responses differed among maternal families, and were also associated with seed mass and germination date.;;;;;;;;;2;2;2;0;4;1226-9239;;BCI:BCI200200238041;

Seedling emergence rate was higher than 90% independently of the duration of seed storage or parental trees. Seed storage shortened significantly the time and increased the uniformity of seedling emergence. Consequently, the delayed seedling emergence from fresh seeds could be explained by epicotyl dormancy. Seed size varied with parental tree. Seedling growth rate was greatly affected by seed size, independently of storage treatment. Seedlings originating from large seeds (>5 g) had the fastest growth rates and seedlings from the smallest seeds (<4 g) had the slowest. Final shoot height, however, depended on the duration of seed storage. The seed size and the duration of storage had a great effect on the initial rate of leaf production, but did not affect the final number of leaves. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was reduced as the duration of seed storage increased but was independent of parental tree (i.e., seed size). Seedling biomass was positively related to seed size.

The hypothesis was tested that this species is more shade intolerant than other co-occurring species.In two 1-yr trials, each with M. bisulcata and four other species at a nursery close to Korup, growth was measured under five PAR levels, with +/- added P and +/- watering in the dry season. In parallel experiments the effects of PAR with two R : FR ratios were investigated.Increasing PAR had a consistent effect on the rates of increase in plant mass and on changes in the other variables. Doubling soil P, watering and halving the R : FR ratio had almost no effect. However, across species, mass at low PAR and relative growth rate related positively and negatively, respectively, to seed mass.One contributing factor for the poor recruitment of M. bisulcata is therefore its low survival and slow growth at low PAR, due to its small seed size. The two codominant ectomycorrhizal grove species of Tetraberlinia, with larger seeds, were less affected by low PAR.

We crossed nine maternal plants with pollen from six pollen donors in a clonal B. pendula seed orchard, measured the pollen-tube growth rates for every cross, and analyzed the performance of the resulting seeds and seedlings. The only significant positive correlation was found between pollen-tube growth rate and seed mass when we controlled for seed number per inflorescence. Using seed mass as a covariate. we found that only maternal parent had a significant effect on the number of seeds per inflorescence, the percentage of germinable and embryonic seeds, and early seedling growth. Both maternal and paternal parents had significant effects on seedling height after 85 d of growth. These results are in concordance with the general view that maternal effects are usually most apparent in seed characters and during early plant growth.

Knowledge of seed germination and seedling establishment is required for the success of efforts on restoration of these forests. This review focuses on the ecological requirements at seed and seedling stages, and collates the current knowledge of seed viability, dormancy, germination pattern and seedling behaviour of dry tropical tree species. The spatio-temporal variations within the tropical dry forest biome in soil moisture, light, temperature, nutrients and intensity of predation, significantly affect the seed and seedling traits of component species. The majority of dry tropical species possess orthodox seeds which are characterized by dormancy, while a few have recalcitrant seeds which possess little or no dormancy. Seed coat dormancy, which can be overcome by mechanical or acid scarification or sometimes by transit through animal guts, is most prevalent in the dry tropical forest species. Persistent species dominating the undisturbed portions of the forest have bigger seeds compared to those that mostly occur in disturbed regions and require shade for the survival of their seedlings. Shade demand is associated with drought endurance, and may be absolute in species such as Guettarda parviflora and Coccoloba microstachya, or facultative as in Plumeria alba and Bursera simaruba. The fluctuation in temperature significantly affects seed germination in several species of dry Afromontane forest trees of Ethiopia. Seedling mortality is primarily a function of moisture stress during the dry period. Adaptive responses of seedlings to drought stress include increased chlorophyll content, for example in Acacia catechu, and root biomass, as in several dry forest species (for example Drypetes parvifolia, Teclia verdoornia) of Ghana. Mulching, application of fertilizers, interplanting of leguminous species and mycorrhizal inoculation are useful tools for promoting seedling establishment in nutrient-poor dry tropical soils. Periodic forest fires, and predation affect recruitment and seedling development according to their intensity. Many species experiencing frequent fires have evolved thick seed coats, produce fire-hardy seedling, or escape the effect by temporal separation of seed dispersal and fire events. Predation may result in abortion of fruits or may enhance germination and recruitment by scarification and dispersal, as in most species of the Guanacaste dry forest. Exposure to elevated CO2 has increased relative growth rate, total leaf area and water use efficiency in most of the dry tropical seedling tested, but the magnitude of the effect has varied markedly among species. Due to the availability of a large source of energy, large seeds show higher germination percentage, greatet seddling survival and increased growth. Seeds originating from different provenances exhibit differences in germination and seedling growth (for example Prosopis cineraria, Albizia lebbeck, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Acacia mangium), efficiency of nodulation (for example Acacia nilotica, A. auriculiformis), and stress resistance (for example Populus deltoides, Dalbergia sissoo). The review points out the need for coordinated, long-term, field-based studies for identification of multiple cues and niches for germination, on seed and seedling dynamics in response to fire, and on within-species genetic variability for selection of suitable provenances.Field-based studies at species and community levels are also needed to permit manipulations of biotic components to augment the recruitment of desired species and to suppress that of undesirable species.;;;;;;;;;91;4;85;9;101;0376-8929;;WOS:000168502300004;

The growth response of seedlings of A. procera from seeds of different sizes was studied under four soil water levels. Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated and grown in a glasshouse for 3 weeks under optimal water supply, and were subsequently maintained at four soil water levels for 4 months. Soil matric potentials for 1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 water holding capacity (WHC) were -0.01, -0.1, -0.61 and -1.20 MPa. respectively. Plant height, stem diameter and leaf area were measured fortnightly. Seedlings were harvested at the end of the experiment. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), stem weight ratio (SWR), root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were determined. Seedlings from large seeds had a higher biomass and leaf area and were more tolerant of long-term extreme water stress compared to those from small seeds which were more tolerant of moderate levels of water stress. Seedlings from small seeds did not survive beyond 75 d at 1/4 WHC. Increase in the R:S ratio along with a decrease in SWR reflected a shift in biomass allocation from above- to below-ground parts as soil water level decreased. SLA declined sharply with increasing water stress, which in turn led to a decrease in RGR. NAR increased with water stress. The study revealed the ability of the species to acclimate to a wide range of moisture stress by morphogenetic (increased R:S ratio and decreased SWR) and physiological (increased NAR) plastic responses.

With a greenhouse experiment we investigated these relationships by examining responses of growth, growth-related morphology, survival, and their interrelationships to a range of nitrogen (3.4 x 10(-9)-3.4 x 10(-3) mol/L N fertilizer solutions) and low light (0.6-7.3% of open sky) availabilities for young seedlings of 10 North American toe species that vary in observational shade tolerance rankings and seed size (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Betula alleghaniensis, Acer saccharum, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana. Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea).Within all species, relative growth rate (RGR) and survival increased with light. RGR and survival also increased with N supply but only at the two highest light levels, and then only for the shade-intolerant, broad-leaved Populus and Betula spp.. In every species, survival was positively related to RGR. Moreover, each species differed in the relationship of survival to RGR, and these differences were related to seed mass: at any given RGR, large-seeded, shade-tolerant species had higher survival than smaller-seeded, intolerant ones.Across species, in most light and N treatments, seed mass was positively related to young seedling survival, but RGR was not. In very low light the relative benefits of greater seed mass to survival were temporary. As seedlings aged, interspecific mortality rates became more dependent on observational shade tolerance rankings than on seed size, but mortality was still unrelated to RGR.Our results indicate potentially important interactions among light, N, and species that could influence regeneration dynamics. For young seedlings in deeply shaded microsites, N supply does not matter, and only shade-tolerant species survive due, in part, to large seeds and physiological traits other than RGR. In moderate shade, RGR is greater, and survival is high for all species, except that small-seeded, broad-leaved, intolerant species have low survival and RGR at low N supply. This suggests that broad-leaved shade-intolerant species compete more effectively in moderate shade on richer soils than on poorer soils. Although we found that both seed mass and vegetative physiology influenced survival in shade, they did nor covary tightly, suggesting that they are under somewhat separate selection pressures.;;;;;;;;;149;7;148;2;163;d_c-58;;WOS:000088214400011;

This was done across 50 Australian species varying in seed reserve mass by eight orders of magnitude during the first week after germination. Proportional increase in hypocotyl length in shade compared to light was similar across the range of seed reserve mass. Etiolation did not lead to increase in hypocotyl length per wet mass, in other words, etiolated hypocotyls were not thinner. However, hypocotyl length per dry mass did increase, more so in smaller-seeded species. Thus, part of the hypocotyl elongation was because of increased water content, which would increase vulnerability to loss of turgor. There was also reallocation of dry matter from root to hypocotyl, again more so in smaller-seeded species, which would decrease anchorage strength and increase vulnerability to soil drying. Results were very similar when considered as correlated evolutionary divergences, compared to the cross-species patterns. The higher-risk etiolation behavior of smaller-seeded species can be understood through their having little to lose. Because they hold less reserve resource uncommitted and attempt a faster initial growth rate, their chances of sustained longevity in shade below the compensation point are very low.;;;;;;;;;17;1;14;1;18;0003-0147;;WOS:000083814000007;

The inhibition of growth at higher irradiance was greater in the more shade-tolerant species.4 Data from growth analyses were used in a principal components analysis to quantify the species' positions on a light response gradient. The growth variables most strongly correlated with this gradient were relative growth rate (RGR) and relative diameter growth in 2% irradiance, and also apparent quantum efficiency and leaf mortality rate in both 2% and 66% irradiance. These results draw attention to the importance of performance in deep forest shade in defining differences among tropical forest tree species.5 The second (independent) axis of the principal components analysis separated three species that are known from other experiments to be drought tolerant. Other species' traits of functional significance (adult deciduousness, seed size, seed dispersal) were only weakly, if at all, associated with the gradient of light response.6 Possible methods for efficient placement of other species on the gradient of light response are discussed. Formulation of standardized conditions simulating deep shade would allow diameter growth to be used as a simple non-destructive measure of a species' position on the gradient of light response, which could then be applied to any tropical forest flora.;;;;;;;;;58;14;59;3;75;0022-0477;;WOS:000083683500007;

Seedlings were grown under controlled, favourable conditions and measurements were made for various growth, morphological and allocation traits.2 Trait correlations across all species were identified, particularly with respect to seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA), a fundamental measure of allocation strategy that reflects the light-capture area deployed per unit of photosynthate invested in leaves.3 Across all species, SLA, specific root length (SRL) and seed reserve mass were the strongest predictors of seedling RGR. That is, a syndrome of leaf and root surface maximization and low seed mass was typical of high RGR plants. This may be a high-risk strategy for individual seedlings, but one presumably mitigated by a larger number of seedlings being produced, increasing the chance that at least one will find itself in a favourable situation.4 Syndromes of repeated attribute divergence were identified in the two sets of gradient PICs. Species from lower resource habitats generally had lower SLA. Thus, in this important respect the two gradients appeared to be variants of a more general 'stress' gradient.5 However, trends in biomass allocation, tissue density, root morphology and seed reserve mass differed between gradients. While SLA and RGR tended to shift together along gradients and in within-habitat PICs, no single attribute emerged as the common, primary factor driving RGR divergences within contrasts. Within-habitat attribute shifts were of similar magnitude to those along gradients.;;;;;;;;;161;7;157;0;170;0022-0477;;WOS:000078762300008;

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species.

There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature.2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates.3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.;;;;;;;;;125;11;126;1;143;0269-8463;;WOS:000076276900009;

RGR, A(sat), leaf and root respiration (R-d), and N uptake rate per unit root mass or length differed significantly among species, ranking (from high to low): Populus, Betula and Larix SPP (all deciduous) and then to five evergreen conifers (Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp,), which were generally comparable in these measures.3, A(sat), leaf and root R-d and N uptake rates were all correlated (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9) with species traits, such as seed mass, leaf life span and shade-tolerance rankings. Mass-based A(sat) was greater in conifer seedlings raised in low than high light. In contrast, area-based A(sat) was higher for plants grown in high than low light, especially in the deciduous species. Once adjusted for differences in plant mass, leaf or root respiration rates did not differ for plants grown in low vs high light.4, Interspecific variation in RGR was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with rates of photosynthesis, respiration and N uptake. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates were correlated to specific leaf area and leaf N concentrations (r approximate to 0.9). Root respiraristi rates, N uptake rates, specific root length (root length per root dry mass) and root N concentrations were all highly correlated with each other (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9). These data suggest a close coupling of tissue-level metabolism, chemistry and structure with whole-plant performance and species ecophysiological and life-history traits.;;;;;;;;;214;15;200;4;237;0269-8463;;WOS:000074764200009;
thick;J;Westoby, M;;;;;;;;A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme;;;;;;;;PLANT AND SOIL;;;;199;2;;;213;227;;10.1023/A:1004327224729;;;FEB 1998;1998;"A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes.The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C-S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance.A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region.The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance.The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.";;;;;;;;;477;43;458;6;537;0032-079X;;WOS:000073701100005;

We studied ten species, which differed by 30-fold in relative growth rate (RGR). We analyzed plant growth in two contrasting light levels during 52 days and two transfers: from high to low (HL) and from low to high (LH) light intensity, and the respective controls in high (HH) and low (LL) light for another 52 days. The photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance were measured at the day of the transfer between light conditions and at the end of the experiment. Species with high RGR showed the largest changes in RGR in response to contrasting light conditions (HH/LL ratio), and species with low RGR showed low responses. The fast-growing species were the most plastic, followed by species with intermediate growth rates, with the slow-growing species being the least plastic. Fast-growing species achieved higher maximum photosynthetic capacities (A(max)) and stomatal conductance and higher response to light than slow-growing species. Species with high RGR showed a low RGR HH/LH ratio, suggesting a large response of L plants when transfered to H. The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35-75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpinia eriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendron mexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.";;;;;;;;;44;5;46;1;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000071009200006;

In 1982 provenance trials were initiated to evaluate the performance of 11 provenances in three experimental sites: De Hoek in the northeastern Transvaal; Frankfort in the eastern Transvaal; and Witfontein in the southern Cape. Only five provenances were planted in all three sites. The great variation in fruit and seed mass could not be related to latitudinal or locality differences of origin of the provenances. Germination capacity ranged between 3 and 94%, but the differences were related to periodically unsuitable environmental conditions during fertilisation of the ovule rather than genetic variation. For most provenances the germination rate over time followed the normal pattern of a sharp increase in germination during October, about 50 weeks after sowing. However, seed from the sub tropical Zululand coast germinated after 10 weeks and continued to germinate without a dormancy period, which suggested a genetic shift with adaptation to the warm, moist conditions along the coast. Tree growth rate showed much promise. At De Hoek the Wonderwoud provenance, the closest source area, performed best with mean DBH of 14,2 cm and mean height of 8,2 m for the 25 tallest trees after 11 years. At Frankfort the Mariepskop provenance, the closest source area, performed best with mean DBH of 10,5 cm and mean height of 8,2 m for the tallest 10 trees after 11 years. At Witfontein the Amatole forest provenances performed best with mean DBH of 9,0 cm and mean height of 5,6 m for the tallest 15 trees after 8,5 years. MAI-20years for P. falcatus Woodbush provenance at De Hoek was calculated as 5,8 m-3/ha compared to 17,3 m-3/ha for Pinus elliottii for the De Hoek plantation. The monetary value of the timber of P. falcatus at age 20 years is, however, higher than that of the timber of P. elliottii. Several recommendations are made: the three experimental plantings should be maintained with application of appropriate silvicultural treatment; for future commercial plantings seed should be collected from several trees of good form and vigour in the immediate source area of the planting site; clonal gains trials should be established for demonstration purposes and to obtain information on which top selections are clonally repeatable; if commercial plantings are to be continued, studies should be initiated on water use of the species, genetic variation of ecotypes of the species, and variation in timber properties of the provenances.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;BCI:BCI199799564660;

Overall mortality in deep shade (0.3, 1.6%) was considerably lower in Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus catharticus, Viburnum lantana and V. opulus. Average mortality in deep shade on grassland soil was negatively correlated with embryo-cum-endosperm dry mass (EEM). Overall mortality in deep shade was significantly greater with higher nutrient supply.3 In 63% daylight relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively correlated with log EEM, and positively with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) at time of planting but not at final harvest, i.e. differences in RGR were determined more by unit leaf rate (rate of dry mass gain/leaf area) in the latter part of the experiment.4 The responses of the species to irradiance and nutrient supply were appreciably different. Cornus, Ligustrum, Prunus spinosa, Rhamnus, and Rosa increased yield strongly under high irradiance on nutrient-poor soil, and responded also markedly to nutrients. Viburnum lantana and Euonymus grew relatively slowly in all treatments, but the former was responsive to nutrients, even in deep shade. Viburnum opulus was more responsive to irradiance but responded to nutrients only in 11% daylight. Crataegus grew more slowly on its 'own' soil than on grassland soil. Juniperus differed consistently from the other species, growing slowly, and responding strongly to irradiance. Fagus responded moderately to irradiance and not to nutrient supply.5 In shade allocation to roots decreased, while allocation to stem and to leaves increased generally. All species produced a smaller number and total area of leaves, and increased SLA and leaf area ratio (leaf area/total dry mass). Shoot and root lengths were reduced in shade.6 The results are discussed in relation to the roles of the various species during secondary succession, and their regeneration niches.;;;;;;;;;116;7;106;1;123;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996WB58300003;

At cotyledon stage (i.e. when placed in dense shade from germination onwards), species with larger seed mass tended to survive longer. This was true within 11 phylogenetically independent contrast (PIG) pairs of plant species, as well as across all 22 species.2 RGR of early seedlings in full light (to day 10 after germination), and cotyledon dark respiration, were measured as potential indicators of the speed with which metabolic resources in the seed were used during early seedling development. These indicators proved not to be such good predictors of longevity under dense shade as was seed mass itself.3 Seedlings were also grown in the light until five days after true leaves appeared, before being transferred to dense shade. The different behaviour of these true-leaf seedlings was consistent with the idea that extra resources in seeds are the direct cause of longer dense-shade survival. Longevity in dense shade at leaf stage was often shorter than for cotyledon-stage seedlings, especially for larger-seeded species: Longevity in dense shade at leaf stage was best correlated with a slow potential RGR in full light measured over days 10-30 of growth. Correlation with seed mass was marginal and probably an indirect correlation via RGR, and there was no correlation with leaf dark respiration.;;;;;;;;;81;6;76;1;90;0022-0477;;WOS:A1996VU80400005;

Treatments included absence and presence of litter in the forest understory, a small gap, and a large gap. Seedling emergence of large-seeded species Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata and Acer mono was not reduced by accumulation of litter in the forest understory, but was promoted in the large gap where litter was less. Seedling emergence of small-seeded species, Alnus hirsuta, Cercidiphyllum japonicum and Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was reduced by the litter in almost all of the sites. Seedlings of large-seeded species avoid shade stress phenologically by unfolding all of their large leaves in a short period before canopy closure in the forest understory. These species had little mortality after seedling emergence. In contrast, small-seeded species have a longer duration of leaf emergence, shorter leaf longevity, and rapid leaf turnover in all the sites. These seedlings attained similar height to those of the large-seeded species at the end of the second year in the large gap, but survival and height growth rate decreased after canopy closure in the forest understory. We suggest that the importance of seed size in determining seedling establishment largely depends on the relationships between seasonal changes of environmental conditions and phenological traits of seedlings, which are related to seed size.;;;;;;;;;84;1;83;1;91;0042-3106;;WOS:A1996UE17800004;

Daytime temperatures were very high during the field experiment and even the most favourable watering treatment showed quite low rates of emergence and survival. This low survival may have reduced the ability to detect a greater advantage of large seeds over small seeds under drier than under better- watered conditions.3 In the glasshouse, the difference in survival from emergence between seedlings from small and large seeds increased under increasingly dry soil conditions, thus supporting the hypothesis. In addition, survival time of seedlings under drying soil conditions was positively associated with seed size.4 The difference in the field results compared with the glasshouse experiment suggests that although large seeds do provide an advantage for seedlings establishing in low soil moisture conditions, this may be realized only under particular field conditions, depending on the characteristics of the rainfall event and the soil conditions. Thus, only a subset of establishment events may provide selection pressure for large seed size.;;;;;;;;;166;17;173;1;193;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NV17600004;

Plants were kept in a shade house for a period of 15 months at 37%, 10% and 2.5% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), roughly corresponding to light environments in large gaps, small gaps, and forest understorey, respectively. The species were chosen to represent a wide array of taxa, ecological, and morphological characteristics, and were assigned regeneration niche (RN) index values based on observations of life history and spatial distribution of their seedlings and saplings in various forest microsites.2 Growth, biomass allocation patterns, leaf anatomy and stomatal responses varied appreciably among species, as well as in response to shading. All species showed reduced growth with decreasing light intensity. Plants grown at 37% and 10% PAR exhibited morphological and physiological responses typical of plants found at forest edges and in large gaps: i.e. low leaf area ratio (LAR), high specific leaf weight (SLW), high root-shoot ratio (RSR), high relative growth rate (RGR), high net assimilation rate (NAR), high leaf conductance, and high chlorophyll a/b ratio. Those grown at 2.5% PAR showed the opposite trends. Comparing species within each light level, NAR and LAR showed positive correlation with RGR, but pooled data for all light levels suggests that the contribution of LAR and NAR to RGR are in opposite directions, depending on light conditions.3 Sensitivity of seedling growth to shading was significantly correlated with mean seed reserve weight of the species: small-seeded species were more affected than large-seeded ones. Relationship between seed reserve weight and species RN index value, though linear, was weak and nonsignificant. RGR was significantly correlated with seed reserve weight at 37% and 10% PAR but not at 2.5% PAR, while LAR showed the opposite trend.4 Plasticity of most parameters examined appeared highest in species that regenerate mostly in large gaps (> 200 m2) and at forest edges, and least in species that regenerate mostly in forest understorey and small gaps (< 50 m2). However, ordination of the study species, using seed size and various shade tolerance criteria for the seedlings, yielded a continuum rather than discrete groups. The first axis, which explained most of the variation (65.6%), was influenced by NAR, RGR, stomatal conductance and total biomass, and was strongly correlated with species regeneration status.;;;;;;;;;113;9;112;7;133;0022-0477;;WOS:A1994NL94400016;

The root, bole and crown zones of such gaps provide very different conditions of nutrient input and root competition and, therefore, should favor trees with different early growth forms and nutrient requirements. The role of gaps in the maintenance of tree species richness is explored by outlining the major differences among the three zones of a single tree-fall gap, demonstrating the high rates of invasions of these gaps by tree seedlings, and predicting the phenotypic traits of seeds and seedlings that should best adapt them to conditions in the different zones. Traits examined include seed size, allocation of cotyledonary reserves, shade tolerance, vertical growth rate, wood density (mechanical strength), armament, branching, leaf layering, leaf orientation, leaf construction and longevity, petioles and mycorrhizal associations. The potential roles of gap size, season of formation, and species of tree that formed the gap are also considered. Tree falls in the temperate zone probably do not have the same effect on tree species richness because of the conditions of tree fall (trunk snapping, falling in winter when no leaves are present), the greater nutrient reserves in temperate forest soils, and the importance of windstorms and fire in temperate forests.;;;;;;;;;105;3;99;3;112;0564-3295;;BCI:BCI198477017955;

Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts.3. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts.4. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density.5. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components.;;;;;;;;;17;3;19;1;21;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200015;

Consequently, subsequent observations, sampled in the environmental archive, can be inversed on the time axis, resulting in a non-physical signal model. In this paper an optimization technique with linear constraints on the signal model parameters is proposed that prevents time inversions. The activation conditions for this constrained optimization are based upon the physical constraint of the growth rate, namely, that it cannot take values smaller than zero. The actual constraints are defined for polynomials and first-order splines as basis functions for the nonlinear contribution in the distance-time relationship. The method is compared with an existing method that eliminates the time inversions, and its noise sensitivity is tested by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the usefulness of the method is demonstrated on the measurements of the vessel density, in a mangrove tree, Rhizophora mucronata, and the measurement of Mg/Ca ratios, in a bivalve, Mytilus trossulus.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1874-8961;;WOS:000293473100003;

Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density.Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk.Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field. Vessel traits and wood density are therefore important components of the performance and life history strategies of tropical tree species.;;;;;;;;;93;2;92;1;96;0028-646X;;WOS:000272893800013;19925555

The variation in anatomical and hydraulic characteristics of branches was considered from three perspectives: vertically within a crown (lower, middle and upper crown), radially along main branches (proximal, middle and distal part), and with respect to branch orders (first-, second- and third-order branches). Hydraulically weighted mean diameter of vessels (D (h)) and theoretical specific conductivity of the xylem (k (t)) exhibited no vertical trend within the tree crown, whereas leaf-specific conductivity of the xylem (LSCt) decreased acropetally. Variation in LSCt was governed by sapwood area to leaf area ratio (Huber value) rather than by changes in xylem anatomy. The acropetal increase in soil-to-leaf conductance (G (T)) within the birch canopy is attributable to longer path length within the lower-crown branches and higher hydraulic resistance of the shade leaves. D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, while vessel density (VD) and relative area of vessel lumina (VA) increased distally along main branches. A strong negative relationship between vessel diameter and VD implies a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability of xylem. D (h) and VD combined explained 85.4% of the total variation of k (t) in the regression model applied to the whole data set. Xylem in fast-growing branches (primary branches) had greater area of vessel lumina per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood, resulting in a positive relationship between branch radial growth rate and k (t). D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, whereas VD increased with increasing branch order. This pattern promotes the hydraulic dominance of primary branches over the secondary branches and their dominance over tertiary branches. In this way crown architecture contributes to preferential water flow along the main axes, potentially providing better water supply for the branch apical bud and foliage located in the outer, better-insolated part of the crown.;;;;;;;;;14;1;12;0;15;0931-1890;;WOS:000254240300009;

This investigation examined the potential use of vessel density as a proxy for soil water salinity in the mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata (Rhizophoraceae) from Kenya.Methods In a time-standardized approach, 50 wood discs from trees growing in six salinity categories were investigated. Vessel densities, and tangential and radial diameters of rainy and dry season wood of one distinct year, at three positions on the stem discs, were measured. A repeated-measures ANOVA with the prevailing salinity was performed.Key Results Vessel density showed a significant increase with salinity, supporting its use as a prospective measure of salinity. Interestingly, the negative salinity response of the radial diameter of vessels was less striking, and tangential diameter was constant under the varying environmental conditions. An effect of age or growth rate or the presence of vessel dimorphism could be excluded as the cause of the absence of any ecological trend.Conclusions The clear trend in vessel density with salinity, together with the absence of a growth rate and age effect, validates the potential of vessel density as an environmental proxy. However, it can only be used as a relative measure of salinity given that other environmental variables such as inundation frequency have an additional influence on vessel density. With view to a reliable, absolute proxy, future research should focus on finding wood anatomical features correlated exclusively with soil water salinity or inundation frequency. The plasticity in vessel density with differing salinity suggests a role in the establishment of a safe water transport system. To confirm this hypothesis, the role of inter-vessel pits, their relationship to the rather constant vessel diameter and the underlying physiology and cell biology needs to be examined.;;;;;;;;;20;0;20;0;21;0305-7364;;WOS:000242245400021;17062590

Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By investigating the xylem anatomy of branches and coarse roots, and measuring branch axial hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation in 4-year-old field-grown aspen plants of five demes (Populus tremula L. and Populus tremuloides Michx.) differing in growth rate, we tested the hypotheses that (i) demes differ in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties, (ii) hydraulic efficiency and safety are related to xylem anatomical traits, and (iii) aboveground productivity and hydraulic efficiency are negatively correlated to cavitation resistance. Significant deme differences existed in seven of the nine investigated branch-related anatomical and hydraulic traits but only in one of the four coarse-root-related anatomical traits; this likely is a consequence of high intra-plant variation in root morphology and the occurrence of a few 'high-conductivity roots'. Growth rate was positively related to branch hydraulic efficiency (xylem-specific conductivity) but not to cavitation resistance; this indicates that no marked trade-off exists between cavitation resistance and growth. Both branch hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency significantly depended on vessel size and were related to the genetic distance between the demes, while the xylem pressure causing 88% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P88 value) was more closely related to hydraulic efficiency than the commonly used P50 value. Deme-specific variation in the pit membrane structure may explain why vessel size was not directly linked to growth rate.

We tested branch wood from co-occurring specimens of these species for the inherent differences in xylem anatomy and theoretical hydraulic conductance to evaluate their resistance to drought or frost. The hydraulic conductivity of the xylem was calculated using a modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation and related to wood density. Conduit dimensions were used to predict the water potential that would cause 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity (I (50)). Nothofagus alpina, which mainly grows at sites with low frost frequency, exhibited the largest conduits and the highest mean values for conduit area, fraction of conduit area in the cross-section and hydraulic conductivity, but the lowest wood density. Opposite relationships were found in the plastic N. antarctica, whose xylem seems to be least vulnerable to freezing-induced, but also to drought-induced embolism. Calculated I (50) was highest (least negative) in N. alpina, indicating a relatively high susceptibility to cavitation. The xylem of the thermophilic N. obliqua and of N. dombeyi, which mainly occurs under oceanic climate, but can also survive at sporadically dry and warm sites, is not particularly adapted to periods of drought stress. Across all species, wood density was negatively correlated with the calculated hydraulic conductance. The xylem traits of N. alpina might contribute to its relatively high growth rate and facilitate its spread into forest gaps.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0931-1890;;WOS:000319015800019;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that tree species sorting on temperature gradients involves a trade-off between growth rate and cold resistance. Little is known about how these two major trade-offs interact.Methods Seedlings of Australian tropical and cool-temperate rainforest trees were grown in glasshouse environments to compare growth versus shade-tolerance trade-offs in these two assemblages. Biomass distribution, photosynthetic capacity and vessel diameters were measured in order to examine the functional correlates of species differences in light requirements and growth rate. Species light requirements were assessed by field estimation of the light compensation point for stem growth.Results Light-demanding and shade-tolerant tropical species differed markedly in relative growth rates (RGR), but this trend was less evident among temperate species. This pattern was paralleled by biomass distribution data: specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) of tropical species were significantly positively correlated with compensation points, but not those of cool-temperate species. The relatively slow growth and small SLA and LAR of Tasmanian light-demanders were associated with narrow vessels and low potential sapwood conductivity.Conclusions The conservative xylem traits, small LAR and modest RGR of Tasmanian light-demanders are consistent with selection for resistance to freeze-thaw embolism, at the expense of growth rate. Whereas competition for light favours rapid growth in light-demanding trees native to environments with warm, frost-free growing seasons, frost resistance may be an equally important determinant of the fitness of light-demanders in cool-temperate rainforest, as seedlings establishing in large openings are exposed to sub-zero temperatures that can occur throughout most of the year.;;;;;;;;;3;0;3;0;3;0305-7364;;WOS:000316691800015;23264237

SG estimation can thus provide important information about the ecological characteristics of fossil assemblages. Since SG is also related to wood productivity, it can also inform about forest biomass and variation in terrestrial carbon stores over time. Here, we develop a straightforward method to predict SG based on wood anatomical traits that are frequently measured when fossil samples are described. We modeled the relationship of SG as a function of fiber and vessel traits in three extant Mexican communities (135 spp) and selected the best predictive equations. Fiber wall to lumen ratio was the variable most highly related with SG and was present in all the selected prediction models; this variable, together with vessel diameter, was part of the best model. In the validation datasets these models provided good estimates of SG both, at individual sample (overall R-2=0.63, varying from 0.44 to 0.84 in different localities) and average community levels. We applied these models to predict SG in three Mexican and one Peruvian fossil assemblages that ranged from Eocene to Miocene in age. To determine the reliability of the estimates, we compared them to observed SG from other extant communities and geographic regions. The estimates of two of the Mexican paleofloras were relatively high, most likely due to deficient preservation. In the other two fossil assemblages, El Cien Formation, Mexico and El Bosque Petrificado Piedra Chamana, Peru, the results were consistent with their inferred paleoenvironment and with the current understanding of the vegetation type they represented. The Peruvian paleoflora had relatively low SG suggesting comparatively higher growth rates and wood productivity, and relatively milder conditions compared to El Cien Formation paleoflora.

Soil chemical factors, texture and compaction are some of the main factors experienced by roots. This study investigates how soil compaction and soil type can modify root anatomy and morphology, and, thus, plant physiology and growth. Seedlings of a woody species (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl.) were grown in a greenhouse with two types of soil (loam and sandy-loam) under a wide range of soil compaction. Despite intrinsic differences in the chemical properties of the two soils, soil compaction explained much of the variation in root morphology and anatomy. We found, in a single species, a high root plasticity in different key root traits as a response to soil compaction. Soil compaction affected negatively the proportion of fine roots, specific root length and proportion of the root xylem vessels. These effects on root traits had an influence on plant physiology and growth. A causal model (by d-sep method) found that soil compaction affected specific root length, and this affects transpiration and photosynthesis rates. Also, the effect of soil compaction on xylem vessel proportion and xylem vessel diameter affected plant area and plain biomass. In conclusion, soil compaction shows an important effect on root anatomy and morphology during the seedling stage, with consequences on plant physiology and growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Wood density is considered a key functional trait influencing the growth and survival of woody plants and has been shown to be related to a slow-fast rate-of-living continuum. Wood density is, however, an emergent trait arising from several vascular properties of wood, including the diameter and frequency of xylem conduits.2. We aimed to test the hypotheses that there is a set of inter-related trade-offs linked to the different functions of wood, that these trade-offs have direct consequences for tree growth and survival and that these trade-offs underlie the observed correlations between wood density and demographic rates. We evaluated the covariation between xylem anatomical traits among woody species of New Zealand and whether that covariation had the potential to constrain variation in wood density and demographic rates.3. Several xylem traits were strongly correlated with each other, but wood density was not correlated with any of them. We also found no significant relationships between wood density and growth or mortality rate. Instead, growth was strongly related to xylem traits associated with hydraulic capacity (conduit diameter and a conductivity index) and to maximum height, whereas mortality rate was strongly correlated only with maximum height. The diameter and frequency of conduits exhibited a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, which restricted variation in wood density and growth rate, but not mortality rate.4. Our results suggest, for woody species in New Zealand, that growth rate is more closely linked to xylem traits determining hydraulic conductance, rather than wood density. We also found no evidence that denser woods conferred higher survival, or that risk of cavitation caused by wide conduits increased mortality.5. In summary, we found little support for the idea that wood density is a good proxy for position along a fast-slow rate-of-living continuum. Instead, the strong, negative relationship between vessel diameter and frequency may constrain the realized diversity of demographic niches of tree species in New Zealand. Trade-offs in function therefore have the potential to shape functional diversity and ecology of forest communities by linking selection on structure and function to population-level dynamics.;;;;;;;;;28;0;27;0;29;0269-8463;;WOS:000274952600002;

Maturation age (the age at which the size of the wood elements is stabilized) was compared to the ages at the boundary between the early and middle stages (age t(1)), and the middle and late stages (age t(2)) of radial stem increment. The maturation age was estimated by nonlinear segmented regression analysis. Ages t(1) and t(2) were estimated by the Gompertz growth function. The maturation age for the length of axial elements (wood fibres and vessel elements) was not related to either age t(1) or age t(2). However, the maturation ages for vessel lumen diameter and ray width were close, and both were related to age t(2).

Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density.Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk.Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field.

The variation in anatomical and hydraulic characteristics of branches was considered from three perspectives: vertically within a crown (lower, middle and upper crown), radially along main branches (proximal, middle and distal part), and with respect to branch orders (first-, second- and third-order branches). Hydraulically weighted mean diameter of vessels (D (h)) and theoretical specific conductivity of the xylem (k (t)) exhibited no vertical trend within the tree crown, whereas leaf-specific conductivity of the xylem (LSCt) decreased acropetally. Variation in LSCt was governed by sapwood area to leaf area ratio (Huber value) rather than by changes in xylem anatomy. The acropetal increase in soil-to-leaf conductance (G (T)) within the birch canopy is attributable to longer path length within the lower-crown branches and higher hydraulic resistance of the shade leaves. D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, while vessel density (VD) and relative area of vessel lumina (VA) increased distally along main branches. A strong negative relationship between vessel diameter and VD implies a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability of xylem. D (h) and VD combined explained 85.4% of the total variation of k (t) in the regression model applied to the whole data set. Xylem in fast-growing branches (primary branches) had greater area of vessel lumina per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood, resulting in a positive relationship between branch radial growth rate and k (t). D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, whereas VD increased with increasing branch order. This pattern promotes the hydraulic dominance of primary branches over the secondary branches and their dominance over tertiary branches. In this way crown architecture contributes to preferential water flow along the main axes, potentially providing better water supply for the branch apical bud and foliage located in the outer, better-insolated part of the crown.;;;;;;;;;14;1;12;0;15;0931-1890;;WOS:000254240300009;

This investigation examined the potential use of vessel density as a proxy for soil water salinity in the mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata (Rhizophoraceae) from Kenya.Methods In a time-standardized approach, 50 wood discs from trees growing in six salinity categories were investigated. Vessel densities, and tangential and radial diameters of rainy and dry season wood of one distinct year, at three positions on the stem discs, were measured. A repeated-measures ANOVA with the prevailing salinity was performed.Key Results Vessel density showed a significant increase with salinity, supporting its use as a prospective measure of salinity. Interestingly, the negative salinity response of the radial diameter of vessels was less striking, and tangential diameter was constant under the varying environmental conditions. An effect of age or growth rate or the presence of vessel dimorphism could be excluded as the cause of the absence of any ecological trend.Conclusions The clear trend in vessel density with salinity, together with the absence of a growth rate and age effect, validates the potential of vessel density as an environmental proxy. However, it can only be used as a relative measure of salinity given that other environmental variables such as inundation frequency have an additional influence on vessel density. With view to a reliable, absolute proxy, future research should focus on finding wood anatomical features correlated exclusively with soil water salinity or inundation frequency. The plasticity in vessel density with differing salinity suggests a role in the establishment of a safe water transport system. To confirm this hypothesis, the role of inter-vessel pits, their relationship to the rather constant vessel diameter and the underlying physiology and cell biology needs to be examined.;;;;;;;;;20;0;20;0;21;0305-7364;;WOS:000242245400021;17062590

Withering is sometimes manifest as die-back, whereby whithering results in shoot death, which progresses downward from the uppermost part of the crown. In this study, we measured the relationships between height growth and diameter at breast height, die-back frequency and severity, vessel size and specific hydraulic conductivity of four evergreen (Senna siamea (Lamk) H.S. Irwin & Barneby, Jacaranda mimosifolia D. Don, Azadirachta indica A.H.L. Juss and Acacia gerrardii Benth.) and one deciduous (Melia volkensii Gurke) plantation tree species in Kenya, which has a conspicuous dry season. Die-back occurred readily in some species, but not in others. Senna siamea showed the highest specific hydraulic conductivity and the highest growth rate among the five species and was quite susceptible to die-back. Among species, height growth and specific hydraulic conductivity were positively correlated with vessel size and negatively correlated with die-back frequency, suggesting a trade-off between growth rate and drought tolerance. This implies that an adaptation to rapid Growth under humid conditions leads to low drought tolerance. However, the deciduous tree Melia volkensii showed high specific hydraulic conductivity and growth, with no symptoms of die-back, implying that a mechanism associated with the deciduous habit results in drought avoidance by reducing the requirement for water during the dry season.;;;;;;;;;12;0;10;0;12;0829-318X;;WOS:000238628500006;16585035

Acer negundo is a ruderal tree, A. saccharinum, and A. rubrum are fast-growing and shade-intolerant soft maples, whereas A. nigrum and A. saccharum are slow-growing and shade-tolerant hard maples. It was hypothesized that the ruderal and soft maples would have lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), but higher maximum specific conductivity (K-s max) than hard maples. Many anatomical and general morphological characteristics were measured in an attempt to correlate them to water transport and/or mechanical strength differences between species. No difference was found between species in vessel diameter, fiber wall thickness, initial hydraulic conductivity (K-h initial), specific conductivity (K-s max), native percent embolism, or Huber value. Similarly, no trade-off was found between K-s max and MOE or MOR across the genus. However, fiber lumen diameter was inversely correlated to MOE and MOR. Surprisingly, percentage of ray parenchyma was positively related to MOE. The results suggest transport/mechanical trade-offs do not occur in Acer and differences in mechanical properties may be due to fiber lumen differences that do not influence the efficient transport of water.;;;;;;;;;26;0;27;0;28;f_vr-22;;WOS:000183133400004;21659164

F), to assess the utilisation potential of short rotation timber. Compared to mature wood, it is characterised by wide rings, short fibres, small diameter, low vessel percentage, high cell wall, wide microfibrillar angle and relatively low or almost similar mechanical properties. While the average modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture in juvenile wood are 85% and 82% respectively of the mature wood value, the longitudinal compression strength is similar. With relatively small fibrillar angle of 15 degrees and the scope for genetic selection of individual trees, teak juvenile wood has potential for desired dimensional stability. The segmented regression models and visual interpretation of radial patterns of variation in anatomical properties reveal that juvenility in plantation grown teak extends up to 15, 20-25 years depending on the property, growth rate and individual tree and plantation site. The fitted regression models, to explain the age-related variations in juvenile wood properties range from simple, linear to exponential, reciprocal and quadratic equations. Fibre length, microfibrillar angle, Vessel diameter/percentage and ring width appear to be the best anatomical indicators of age demarcation between juvenile and mature wood, although maturation age often varies among the properties. The projected figures for proportion of juvenile wood in plantation grown teak at breast height are 80-100% and 25% at ages 20 and 60 years respectively.;;;;;;;;;52;1;27;7;57;0043-7719;;WOS:000167535000007;

To this aim we use a large database with innate seedling mean relative growth rates (RGR) for 97 European woody species. Before we considered it legitimate to scale up from the species level, we first addressed some potential pitfalls due to plant analysis and RGR definition. Subsequently we evaluated the roles of seed reserves and ontogeny/allometry; the possible risks of extrapolation to other (natural) environments; and the role of intraspecific variation in innate mean RGR. None of these factors appeared to affect the broad RGR ranking of the species seriously. Close correlates of seedling mean RGR among woody species were leaf area ratio (LAR) as well as both LAR components, specific leaf area and leaf mass ratio. We then scaled up to larger species assemblages, focusing first on higher taxa and functional types. Higher taxa, life-form, leaf habit, xylem type, life strategy and successional status could each explain part of the interspecific variation in mean RGR. In many cases the contributions of individual factors could be teased out by holding other factors constant, or using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Some of the consistent findings were as follows: woody species belonging to more advanced dicot families grew innately faster than more primitive ones; angiosperm trees faster than gymnosperm trees; deciduous species faster than evergreens; woody climbers and scramblers faster than self-supporting life-forms; shrubs and subshrubs faster than trees; trees with bud-break early in spring and indeterminate shoot growth faster than trees with delayed phenology and determinate shoot growth. This was to some extent correlated with the xylem Vessel size distribution. Trees with ruderal features grew innately faster than more competitive trees, followed by relatively stress-tolerant trees. Pioneer trees tended to grow innately faster than late-successional ones. Then, we tentatively scaled up from innate seedling mean RGR to ecosystem properties. Mediated by nutrient conservation through leaf longevity and anti-herbivore defences, (often evergreen) slow-growing species were found to produce more persistent litter than (often deciduous) fast-growing ones. This could have implications for nutrient turn-over rates in ecosystems. Finally, the woody flora from western Europe's cool-temperate climate belt grew inherently faster than that from a woody flora in the Mediterranean belt, and perhaps faster than that from the Boreal belt.";;;;;Workshop on Inherent Variation in Plant Growth Rate;JUN, 1997;"Utrecht Univ, Fac Biol; Federat European Soc Plant Physiol; Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci; Backhuys Publ, Leiden; Utrecht Univ, Ecophysiol Res Grp";UTRECHT UNIV, UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS;53;0;51;0;55;;90-73348-96-X;WOS:000076263300020;

Anatomical characteristics, specific gravity, and bending properties were determined at breast height for thirty 7-year-old trees with varying growth rates, from a red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) plantation. Wood was sampled from the growth ring with a cambial age of 5 years. Growth varied from 2.0 to 9.3 mm/year (ring width), or 264 to 3350 mm(2)/year (ring area). We analyzed the relationship between growth rate, in terms of both annual ring width and area, and each wood property. Because both measures of growth rate yielded the same qualitative results, we only used ring width in our analyses. Regression analysis showed that growth rate had no effect on specific gravity, the modulus of elasticity in bending, the modulus of rupture in bending, fiber diameter, or the proportion of growth ring that was fiber or vessel. Fiber length, vessel diameter, and ray proportion, however, were positively correlated with growth rate. Fiber-wall thickness and axial parenchyma proportion decreased slightly with growth rate.

In this study the intercorrelation between wood properties, the variation among families and the effect of growth rate on these properties were studed in 216 young trees sampled from a full-sib diallel progeny trial consisting of 72 families established in the Eastern Transvaal by the Department of Environment Affairs. Results of a factor analysis indicated that the variations in the basic wood properties of young E. grandis is adequately described by studying wood density, fibre lengths and vessel properties such as size, frequency and fractional volume. All these properties vary significantly among families suggesting some genetic influence. Heritability estimates obtained for density, fibre length and vessel diameter are more or less similar in magnitude to those found in previous studies. This, as a number of other studies, indicated no significant or practically important phenotypic correlation between growth rate and wood properties.

Thus, foresters require more information of native tree species envisaged for reforestation. This study examines the relationship between productivity and possibly growth-determining functional traits of xylem anatomy, hydraulic conductivity, foliar morphology and nutrient status in eight tree species in semi-dry Costa Rica; we further assessed the indicative value of wood density for growth rate and hydraulic efficiency. We tested the hypotheses that (i) wood density is related to both growth rate and hydraulic efficiency contrary to findings from moist tropical forests, and (ii) productivity is closely related to branch xylem properties as well as empirically determined hydraulic conductivity in these drought-adapted species. Growth rate was positively related to tree size, foliar nitrogen content, vessel diameter, specific conductivity and leaf water potential, and negatively to vessel density, wood density and delta C-13, indicating that fast-growing tree species with light wood possessed a more efficient hydraulic system but closed their stomata relatively early to prevent xylem dysfunction. We conclude, that in tropical semi-dry climates, productivity is closely associated not only with foliar nitrogen but also with wood anatomical and hydraulic properties. Wood density proved to be a reliable indicator for growth-related, wood anatomical and hydraulic traits in these drought-adapted species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There has been increasing interest in planting and managing C. paliurus for timber production and medical use owing to loss of harvestable acreage. Seed from six provenances was collected from the main natural range of this species. Significant variation in growth and wood properties was measured among the six provenances at age 7 years. Provenance mean height and DBH varied significantly from 730-991 and 6.7-10.0 cm, whereas provenance means of wood basic density and crystallinity ranged from 463-554 kg m(-3) and 51.4-74.1 %, respectively. Mean provenance microfibril angle (MFA) at breast height ranged from 18.1A degrees to 23.2A degrees, while MFA at breast height varied from 11.0A degrees to 34.5A degrees among growth rings which showed a consistent pith-to-bark trend of declining angles. There was no significant relationship of growth rate with latitude or longitude of seed sources, however, provenances from low latitude and longitude grew faster at the trial site. Wood quality was significantly related to latitude of seed sources, showing a positive correlation for both wood basic density and wood crystallinity, but a highly negative association with MFA. Significant correlations between wood properties measured indicated that there exists a great opportunity to improve wood quality of C. paliurus through selection of juvenile trees with low MFA.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0169-4286;;WOS:000340526000002;

The mean values of functional traits and soil environmental factors for each species that were related to RGR varied with ontogenetic stage. Sapling RGR showed greater relationships with functional traits than large-tree RGR, whereas large-tree RGR was more associated with soil environment than was sapling RGR. The strongest single predictors of RGR were wood density for saplings and slope aspect for large trees. The stepwise regression model for large trees accounted for a larger proportion of variability (R (2) = 0.95) in RGR than the model for saplings (R (2) = 0.55). Functional diversity analysis revealed that the process of habitat filtering likely contributes to the substantial changes in regulation of RGR as communities transition from saplings to large trees.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0029-8549;;WOS:000339893600025;24938832

To date, these relationships have not been comprehensively quantified in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.).The aim of this study was to describe the variation in annual ring density in black spruce as a function of cambial age, stem height and growth rate.Radial density profiles from 107 black spruce trees were analysed using a two-stage modelling approach. First, the parameters of a nonlinear function were estimated separately for individual samples. Linear regression was then used to model the parameters obtained in the first stage as functions of internal and external tree descriptors.Annual ring density was high near the pith and declined rapidly in the first 15 annual rings before increasing to more stable values between rings 25 and 60. However, just below 25 % of the samples showed a gradual decline towards the bark, typically after ring 60.Describing and quantifying radial density patterns, including the decline close to the bark, will help further our understanding of the links between tree growth and ring density over the life of the tree.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;1;1286-4560;;WOS:000337089800009;

The study was based on two long-term experiments with two fertilization treatments (unfertilized and 150 kg N ha(-1) every 5 years) and two thinning levels (delayed and intensive first commercial thinning) in a randomized block design. A total of 80 trees were sampled similar to 30 years after the onset of the treatments. Intensive thinning enhanced the radial growth of the remaining trees by 52 per cent compared with the delayed first thinning. Accordingly, the fertilization increased the radial growth by 37 per cent compared with the unfertilized trees. However, only small differences were found between the treatments in the earlywood/latewood ratio (3-9 per cent), wood density (2-8 per cent), tracheid diameter (2-5 per cent), cell wall thickness (0-10 per cent) and tracheid length (4-5 per cent). The results demonstrated that the prevailing fertilization and thinning treatments of Scots pine stands considerably enhance the growth rate but do not cause major detrimental changes in the wood and tracheid properties.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0015-752X;;WOS:000335913200009;

A pan-tropical review of recorded drought-related tree mortalities in more than 100 monitoring plots before, during and after drought events suggested a higher drought-vulnerability of trees in South-East Asian than in Amazonian forests. Here, we present the results of a replicated (n=3 plots) throughfall exclusion experiment in a perhumid tropical rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this first large-scale roof experiment outside semihumid eastern Amazonia, 60% of the throughfall was displaced during the first 8months and 80% during the subsequent 17months, exposing the forest to severe soil desiccation for about 17months. In the experiment's second year, wood production decreased on average by 40% with largely different responses of the tree families (ranging from -100 to +100% change). Most sensitive were trees with high radial growth rates under moist conditions. In contrast, tree height was only a secondary factor and wood specific gravity had no influence on growth sensitivity. Fine root biomass was reduced by 35% after 25months of soil desiccation while fine root necromass increased by 250% indicating elevated fine root mortality. Cumulative aboveground litter production was not significantly reduced in this period. The trees from this Indonesian perhumid rainforest revealed similar responses of wood and litter production and root dynamics as those in two semihumid Amazonian forests subjected to experimental drought. We conclude that trees from paleo- or neotropical forests growing in semihumid or perhumid climates may not differ systematically in their growth sensitivity and vitality under sublethal drought stress. Drought vulnerability may depend more on stem cambial activity in moist periods than on tree height or wood specific gravity.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1354-1013;;WOS:000334361000011;24115242

Several functional traits have been shown to correlate with growth and mortality rates in trees, but less is known about how the relationships between functional traits and demographic rates change with tree size.We examined the associations of functional traits with growth and mortality across 43 tree species in the Fushan 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot in northern Taiwan. We estimated the 95th percentile maximum stem diameter, wood density and six leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, succulence, and mass-based nitrogen and phosphorus contents) obtained from leaves on juvenile and adult individuals of each species.To quantify size-dependent changes in growth and mortality, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality were estimated as a function of stem diameter using hierarchical Bayesian models. These rate estimates were then correlated with functional traits at a range of stem diameter classes.Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates varied with tree size. Maximum size was positively correlated with RGR across a wide range of tree sizes. Wood density was negatively correlated with RGR and mortality for small-sized trees. Leaf traits such as leaf area and specific leaf area at juvenile and adult stages were associated more strongly with demographic rates for corresponding sizes than from other sizes.Synthesis. The observed size-dependent changes in the trait-demography relationships are possibly due to the effects of developmental and environmental changes with increasing tree size. The underlying effects of functional traits on demographic performance vary with tree size, and this should influence dynamics in a tree community.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0022-0477;;WOS:000334588300010;

To date, few studies have quantified how size-dependent changes in growth and mortality rates co-vary with architectural traits, and how such size-dependent changes differ across species and possible light capture strategies. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify size-dependent changes in demographic rates and correlated demographic rates and architectural traits for 145 co-occurring Malaysian rain-forest tree species covering a wide range of tree sizes. Demographic rates were estimated using relative growth rate in stem diameter (RGR) and mortality rate as a function of stem diameter. Architectural traits examined were adult stature measured as the 95-percentile of the maximum stem diameter (upper diameter), wood density, and three tree architectural variables: tree height, foliage height, and crown width. Correlations between demographic rates and architectural traits were examined for stem diameters ranging from 1 to 47 cm. As a result, RGR and mortality varied significantly with increasing stem diameter across species. At smaller stem diameters, RGR was higher for tall trees with wide crowns, large upper diameter, and low wood density. Increased mortality was associated with low wood density at small diameters, and associated with small upper diameter and wide crowns over a wide range of stem diameters. Positive correlations between RGR and mortality were found over the whole range of stem diameters, but they were significant only at small stem diameters. Associations between architectural traits and demographic rates were strongest at small stem diameters. In the dark understory of tropical rain forests, the limiting amount of light is likely to make the interspecific difference in the effects of functional traits on demography more clear. Demographic performance is therefore tightly linked with architectural traits such as adult stature, wood density, and capacity for horizontal crown expansion. The enhancement of a demographic trade-off due to interspecific variation in functional traits in the understory helps to explain species coexistence in diverse rain forests.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;d_c-58;;WOS:000331429500010;24669729

A data set of 27 trees from even-aged stands (EAS) was used for comparison. In the UAS trees, high density and narrow annual rings were found in the juvenile wood near the pith. Thereafter, wood density rapidly decreased until the 20th annual ring, followed by an increase toward the bark. In the outermost rings, wood density again slightly decreased. The trends in wood density in the UAS trees correspond with those reported for naturally regenerated, even-aged Norway spruce stands, with the exception of the decrease in the outermost rings. A mixed linear model with ring width, cambial age, and canopy position as fixed parameters accounted for 53% of the variation in wood density of the UAS trees. In contrast to UAS trees, EAS trees showed increased wood density in the outer rings as a result of decreasing growth rate. The abrupt change in wood density of UAS trees may affect the properties of timber sawn close to the pith.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0045-5067;;WOS:000331090300005;

An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.;;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;5;0027-8424;;WOS:000329614500046;24379395

For this purpose, 25 sample areas have been considered among Artvin-Arhavi, Trabzon-Akcaabat and Giresun-Espiye regions. At each sample area, one tree with dominant height has been cut down. Suitable materials have been obtained from such trees in order to determine the anatomic, physical and mechanical properties of wood. Properties of alder wood, such as width of annual ring, oven-dry wood density, bending strength, modulus of elasticity, dynamic bending and compressive strength parallel to grain have been determined. Site indices of sample areas have been determined by using the age-height relation of standard age trees. Soil samples have been taken at soil profiles opened at sample areas from depths of 0-10 cm, 10-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-80 cm and 80-120 cm. Sand, dust, clay, available water capacity, soil organic matter and soil reaction (pH) have been determined in soil samples. Whether the wood properties differentiate as per different sites has been revealed by the variance analysis, and how they change as per significant environmental conditions, such as altitude and precipitation at the same site, has been revealed by the correlation analysis. As e result of statistical analysis, it has been determined that all the wood properties differentiate as per sites, and wood properties at different sites are related with the site factors.

Despite sustaining a high rate of severe damage (34.6% of all trees snapped, 23.0% uprooted), system resilience was high with 74.3 percent stem survival overall and an annual mortality rate of 7.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent in nearby undisturbed late successional forest. Three-yr survival rate of trees sustaining severe damage was 63.1 percent, compared to about 89 percent for trees sustaining only branch loss or defoliation. Three-yr survival differed according to damage type, 78.5 percent after snapping vs. 38.4 percent after uprooting. Species differed widely in resistance to and survival after snapping and uprooting. Several species and individual traits were associated with the probability of snapping or uprooting; however, wood density was the only species trait consistently, and negatively, associated with the probability of sustaining either damage type. Survival after snapping was negatively associated with the proportion of the tree snapped off, which was determined by individual tree architecture. Species growth rate was negatively associated with survival after uprooting, indicating the importance of shade tolerance for survival after uprooting. Thus, whereas species traits seemed to exclusively underpin resistance to and survival after uprooting, they only partly accounted for snapping resistance, and did not determine the intensity of snap damage or survival after snapping.

Thus, rigorous WD estimates are necessary to identify factors affecting tree performance. We obtained 1766 records of WD from the literature for 141 tree species in the United States. We implemented a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) meta-analysis that incorporated sample size, variance, covariate (e.g. moisture content and latewood proportion) and methodological information to obtain standardized estimates of WD for 305 U.S. tree species. The HB framework allowed borrowing of strength' between species such that WD estimates for data-poor species were informed by data-rich species via taxonomic or phylogenetic relationships. After accounting for important covariates and sampling effects, evaluation of the residual variation revealed the potential importance of environmental factors and evolutionary history. Differential variation in WD between species within genera and between genera within orders suggested that WD is relatively conserved in some genera and orders, but not in others. WD also varied between studies (or sites) indicating the potential influence of edaphic, topographic, or population factors on intraspecific variation in WD.Synthesis. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach overcomes many of the limitations of traditional meta-analyses, and the incorporation of phylogenetic or taxonomic information facilitates estimates of trait values for data-poor species. We provide relatively well-constrained WD estimates for 305 tree species, which may be useful for tree growth and forest models, and the uncertainties associated with the estimates may inform future sampling campaigns.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0022-0477;;WOS:000328555600022;

Resprouting has been discussed from two adaptation perspectives: recovery from damage by catastrophic disturbance and survival in frequently disturbed shaded understorey. However, few studies have comprehensively dealt with both adaptation types to understand resprouting strategies. To understand the adaptive significance of resprouting, we assessed the size dependence of resprouting ability after stem clipping for 24 deciduous broad-leaved species, including shrubs, sub-canopy and canopy trees, in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The community assembly includes species adapted to past catastrophic disturbances (e.g. fire, logging) and to stable forest with intermittent treefall (currently the dominant disturbance). We correlated resprouting ability with life-history strategies based on demographic parameters and plant functional traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness and wood density. All the studied species could resprout in juveniles, and resprouting ability increased as stump size increased. Most sub-canopy and canopy trees lost their ability to resprout after attaining a particular stump size, whereas shrub species retained the ability to resprout throughout their lifetimes. The relative growth rate, LMA and foliar nitrogen did not greatly influence the resprouting ability of a species. In contrast, species with smaller maximum size, lower leaf toughness and lower wood density had better juvenile resprouting ability. This better resprouting ability may have evolved because these characteristics make them more vulnerable to shaded understorey. However, species with larger maximum size and lower leaf toughness retained their ability to resprout to a larger size.Synthesis. A better resprouting ability is related to the ability to survive frequent disturbances, in juveniles, which are characteristics of both forest understorey and frequent fire or drought. To retain resprouting ability until grown seems to be an adaptation to survive infrequent large disturbances. Light-demanding species, which generally have better resprouting ability than shade-tolerants both in juveniles and adults, are adapted to disturbances of various scale and frequency; however, shade-tolerants could survive well in the understorey due to a combination of stronger physical defences and resprouting ability.";;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0022-0477;;WOS:000328555600023;

We studied species turnover, mortality and recruitment, and population dynamism for different successional groups based on three datasets collected between 2001 and 2010 from a permanent 120 m x 80 m plot in a Fagus engleriana-Cyclobalanopsis multinervis mixed forest patch in central China, to identify trends in forest change and explore the possible effects of ice storm in 2008 on forest dynamics. The majority of woody species in this forest belonged to early- and late-successional species and the proportion of evergreen species was lower than that of deciduous in terms of species richness. Floristic composition showed minor structural and compositional changes with no shift in the rank of importance value index among different successional groups, over the study periods, whereas stem density and basal area changed markedly between 2006 and 2010, probably as a consequence of the ice storm in 2008. Size distributions of living individuals were similar between census intervals for all successional groups, approximating an inverse J-shaped distribution for early- and late-successional species groups and a bell-shaped distribution for pioneer species, whereas size distributions of dead individuals varied significantly for all successional groups. Furthermore, patterns of mortality and recruitment displayed disequilibrium behaviors over the investigated period with mortality surpassing recruitment for all successional groups during the final census. Surprisingly, diameter growth rates reached a maximum during the final census interval (2006-2010) among all successional groups. All successional groups also showed size-dependent growth with maximal growth rates attained among the largest-sized classes except for pioneer species, which exhibited the highest growth rates at mid-sized classes. Moreover, ice-storm in 2008 also accelerated dynamisms among successional groups to different extents. The dynamism gauged by stem density was significantly lower than that based on basal area among successional groups during 2001-2006 but the reverse situation was observed in the later census interval, demonstrating the divergence in diameter growth rate but not in recruitment individuals between the two census intervals made large contribution to this observation. Taken together, these results indicate that despite the 2008 ice-storm this forest was generally resilient, undergoing only minor structural and compositional shifts, although an accelerated rate of forest dynamism among successional groups was linked to the period that included the ice storm. Therefore, long-term observation is needed to further reveal direct evidence of relationships between disturbance and forest dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in the structure, growth and productivity of mangrove forests over climatic gradients suggests they are sensitive to variations in climate, but evidence of changes in the structure and growth of mangrove trees in response to climatic variation is scarce. Bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating provides accurate dates of recent wood formation and tree age of tropical and subtropical tree species. Here, we used radiocarbon techniques combined with X-ray densitometry to develop a wood density chronology for the mangrove Avicennia marina in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia (WA). We tested whether wood density chronologies of A. marina were sensitive to variation in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index, which reflects temperature fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean and is linked to the instrumental rainfall record in north WA. We also determined growth rates in mangrove trees from the Exmouth Gulf, WA. We found that seaward fringing A. marina trees (similar to 10 cm diameter) were 48 +/- 1 to 89 +/- 23 years old (mean +/- 1 sigma) and that their growth rates ranged from 4.08 +/- 2.36 to 5.30 +/- 3.33 mm/yr (mean +/- 1 sigma). The wood density of our studied mangrove trees decreased with increases in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index. Future predicted drying of the region will likely lead to further reductions in wood density and their associated growth rates in mangrove forests in the region.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1932-6203;;WOS:000327252100130;24265797

Previous studies, mainly led in the Neotropics and in Southeast Asia, have yielded contradictory results which might be explained by differences in species studied, in the tree development stages considered, or by differences in other environmental factors than water availability. Here, we described the growth responses of functional groups of tree species to drought in a Central African semi-deciduous moist forest. Species groups were automatically defined using a finite mixture model, which grouped species according to their growth model parameters. The growth model considered the variation in species response to drought, and the effect of competition for resources and of tree development stage on growth. Groups were further characterized by species functional traits. Nine species groups were identified. They differed in their ability to acquire, use and conserve resources, as suggested by their differences in maximum growth rate, regeneration guild, maximum dbh, wood density and leaf habit. The species were organized along a light requirement gradient that here closely matched a broader continuum of plant strategies for resource use, from slow-growing shade-tolerant conservative species to fast-growing pioneer acquisitive species. Tree growth decreased with drought intensity, and species drought tolerance was found to be related to resource use strategy: slow-growing species using a conservative strategy were the least sensitive to variations in water availability, while fast-growing species using an acquisitive strategy were the most sensitive.Synthesis. Shade-tolerant species, characterized by a low potential growth rate and thus a conservative strategy of resource use, were found to be the least sensitive to drought. This supports the hypothesis of a single axis summarizing multiple traits that represents a general trade-off between the conservation and rapid acquisition of resources.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0022-0477;;WOS:000325984300010;

Suites of correlated functional traits may reflect fundamental tradeoffs and general plant strategies and hence represent trait spectra along which plant species can vary according to their respective strategies. However, the functional interpretation of these trait spectra requires the inspection of their relation to plant performance. We employed principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) to quantify fundamental whole-plant trait spectra based on 23 traits for 305 North American woody species that span boreal to subtropical climates. We related the major axes of PCoA to five measures of plant performance (i.e., growth rate, and tolerance to drought, shade, water-logging and fire) for all species and separately for gymnosperms and angiosperms. Across all species a unified gymnosperm-angiosperm trait spectrum (wood density, seed mass, rooting habit) is identified, which is correlated with drought tolerance. Apart from this, leaf type and specific leaf area (SLA) strongly separate gymnosperms from angiosperms. For gymnosperms, one trait spectrum emerges (seed mass, rooting habit), which is positively correlated with drought tolerance and inversely with shade tolerance, reflecting a tradeoff between these two strategies due to opposing trait characteristics. Angiosperms are functionally more diverse. The trait spectra related to drought tolerance and shade tolerance are decoupled and three distinct strategies emerge: high drought tolerance (low SLA, dense wood, heavy seeds, taproot), high shade tolerance (high SLA, shallow roots, high toxicity, opposite arranged leaves), and fast growth/stress intolerance (large maximum heights, soft wood, light seeds, high seed spread rate). In summary, our approach reveals that complex suits of traits and potential tradeoffs underlie fundamental performance strategies in forests. Studies relying on small sets of plant traits may not be able to reveal such underlying strategies.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;2150-8925;;WOS:000327380400011;

It is not clear how its natural durability is influenced by silviculture. We therefore investigated how the natural durability of the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) varies according to tree growth rate; subsequently, the influence of the nature of the wood (juvenile or mature) and radial position was also analyzed. For this purposes, a total of 60 trees grown in Wallonia (Southern Belgium) was felled: these consisted of 6 trees in each of 10 stands where the average tree girth was approximately 150 cm. Since the age of these plantations ranged from 40 to 69 years, the radial tree growth rate ranged between approximately 3 and 7 mm. In all the trees, standardized heartwood test specimens were taken from different radial positions in the butt log. The mass losses caused by the fungi Poria placenta and Coniophora puteana were assessed according to CEN/TS 15083-1 (2005). Poria placenta exhibited a higher decaying efficiency than C. puteana, leading to classify Douglas-fir wood as slightly durable (class 4). No difference was observed between the durability against P. placenta of juvenile and mature wood. Similarly, growth rate seemed to have no direct impact on durability. Durability was, however, significantly correlated with wood density. The effect of site and tree on the natural durability of the wood was also examined.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0045-5067;;WOS:000325456800001;

We used two censuses performed on trees with a diameter at breast height of >= 10 cm in 10 1-ha plots to answer the following questions: (1) Does prior use of the land for raising crops (instead of pastureland for cattle ranching) promote an increase in the rate of AGB accumulation? (2) To what extent did climate, soil characteristics, the functional traits of resident species, and/or stand age affect the stocks and dynamics of the AGB in these secondary forests? We did not find any evidence that prior land use for cattle ranching had a negative effect on the tree AGB-accumulation rate, when compared with land previously used for raising crops. Greater AGB stocks at an intermediate fertility point may be associated with a higher abundance of tall, short-lived, fast-growth pioneer species. Tree mortality rates in secondary forests were primarily determined by the forest's composition and the variation in the amount of rainfall between sites. Soil fertility, which is known to accelerate the growth rate of plant species, was significantly and positively associated with the rate of AGB recruitment. We did not find any evidence for a negative correlation between wood density and growth, as has been reported for primary tropical forests. The net AGB change (%) was primarily associated with the low soil-fertility characteristics of sandy well-drained soils that could, in the presence of steep slopes, increase forest dynamics. Land restoration that restores the natural cycle of secondary forests could assist in the mitigation of global warming by promoting key environmental functions, such as carbon sequestration.

In many cases, there are trade-offs in carbon allocations between growth and storage in seedlings. However, this trade-off is likely to change with growth stages from seedling to mature plant because carbon investments in reproductive activities and/or risk of disturbance also change by species and growth stage. To examine how sprouting ability and carbohydrate storage change with growth stage, we compared two tropical secondary-forest trees, Macaranga bancana and M. gigantea, which have different ecological traits. Maximum tree size and growth rate are higher in M. gigantea. We monitored sprout growth and stored resources, including total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) and nitrogen in the root, among different tree sizes for 12 months following stem-cutting treatment. Sprouting ability (total sprout mass) and TNC concentrations were significantly higher in small individuals than in larger specimens in both species. TNC concentration decreased in all size classes after stem cutting. Macaranga bancana had greater sprout survivorship than M. gigantea, which had higher sprouting ability in larger tree-size classes. Thus, sprouting ability likely depends on root TNC concentration and tree-size class in both Macaranga species. Higher TNC concentration and sprout survival rates in M. bancana may be related to greater carbon allocation in survival than in growth. This hypothesis is consistent with the ecological traits of M. bancana, such as its growth rate, which was lower than that of M. gigantea.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;juin-06;;WOS:000321210900003;

Their ability to tolerate drought stress plays a vital role in determining growth and mortality rates, as well as shaping the functional composition of tropical forests. In order to assess the ability of species to acclimate to contrasting levels of drought stress, physiological and structural traits involved in drought adaptation-wood C isotope discrimination (delta C-13), wood specific gravity, and wood C content-of 2-year-old saplings of nine tropical tree species were evaluated in common garden experiments at two study sites in Panama with contrasting seasonality. We assessed co-variation in wood traits with relative growth rates (RGR(BD)), aboveground biomass, and basal diameter and the plasticity of wood traits across study sites. Overall, species responded to lower water availability by increasing intrinsic water-use efficiency, i.e., less negative wood delta C-13, but did not exhibit a uniform, directional response for wood specific gravity or wood C content. Trait plasticity for all wood traits was independent of RGR(BD) and tree size. We found that the adaptive value of intrinsic water-use efficiency varied with water availability. Intrinsic water-use efficiency increased with decreasing RGR(BD) at the more seasonal site, facilitating higher survival of slower growing species. Conversely, intrinsic water-use efficiency increased with tree size at the less seasonal site, which conferred a competitive advantage to larger individuals at the cost of greater susceptibility to drought-induced mortality. Our results illustrate that acclimation to water availability has negligible impacts on tree growth over short periods, but eventually could favor slow-growing species with conservative water-use strategies in tropical regions experiencing increasingly frequent and severe droughts.;;;;;;;;;4;0;3;0;4;0931-1890;;WOS:000319015800015;

We tested branch wood from co-occurring specimens of these species for the inherent differences in xylem anatomy and theoretical hydraulic conductance to evaluate their resistance to drought or frost. The hydraulic conductivity of the xylem was calculated using a modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation and related to wood density. Conduit dimensions were used to predict the water potential that would cause 50 % loss of hydraulic conductivity (I (50)). Nothofagus alpina, which mainly grows at sites with low frost frequency, exhibited the largest conduits and the highest mean values for conduit area, fraction of conduit area in the cross-section and hydraulic conductivity, but the lowest wood density. Opposite relationships were found in the plastic N. antarctica, whose xylem seems to be least vulnerable to freezing-induced, but also to drought-induced embolism. Calculated I (50) was highest (least negative) in N. alpina, indicating a relatively high susceptibility to cavitation. The xylem of the thermophilic N. obliqua and of N. dombeyi, which mainly occurs under oceanic climate, but can also survive at sporadically dry and warm sites, is not particularly adapted to periods of drought stress. Across all species, wood density was negatively correlated with the calculated hydraulic conductance. The xylem traits of N. alpina might contribute to its relatively high growth rate and facilitate its spread into forest gaps.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0931-1890;;WOS:000319015800019;

The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (A (max), V (cmax), J (max)) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (K (L)) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (K (R)) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.";;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0912-3814;;WOS:000318569100016;

This function, known as an environmental filter, varies in space and affects community composition. However, filters are poorly characterized because dispersal patterns can obscure environmental effects, and few studies utilize longitudinal data linking individual performance to environment. We model the effects of environmental filters on demographic rates of nearly all tree species (99) in a 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of environmental filtering, drawing inspiration from classic studies of intraspecific natural selection. We characterize the specific environmental gradients and trait axes most important in filtering of demographic rates across species. We found that stronger filtering along a given trait axis corresponded to less spatial variation in the value of favoured traits. Environmental gradients associated with filtering were different for growth versus survivorship. Species maximum height was under the strongest filtering for growth, with shorter species favoured on convex ridges. Shorter stature species may be favoured on ridges because trees on ridges experience higher wind damage and lower soil moisture. Wood density filtering had the strongest effects on survival. Steep slopes and high available P in the soil favoured species with low-density wood. Such sites may be favourable for fast-growing species that exploit resource-rich environments. Synthesis: We characterized trait-mediated environmental filters that may underlie spatial niche differentiation and life-history trade-offs, which can promote species coexistence. Filtering along trait axes with the strongest effects on local community composition, that is, traits with the strongest filtering, may necessarily have a weaker potential to promote species coexistence across the plot. The weak spatial variation in filters with strong effects on demography may result from long-term processes affecting the species pool that favour habitat generalist strategies.;;;;;;;;;7;0;6;0;7;0022-0477;;WOS:000318186800018;

Saplings of six dominant canopy species differing in shade tolerance were grown in five control and five N + P fertilized gaps. Hydraulic architectural traits such as wood density, the leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA : SA), vulnerability to cavitation (P50) and specific and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity were measured, as well as the relative growth rate, specific leaf area (SLA) and percentage of leaf damage by insect herbivores. Plant growth rates and resistance to drought-induced embolisms increased when nutrient limitations were removed. On average, the P50 of control plants was -1.1 MPa, while the P50 of fertilized plants was -1.6 MPa. Wood density and LA : SA decreased with N + P additions. A trade-off between vulnerability to cavitation and efficiency of water transport was not observed. The relative growth rate was positively related to the total leaf surface area per plant and negatively related to LA : SA, while P50 was positively related to SLA across species and treatments. Plants with higher growth rates and higher total leaf area in fertilized plots were able to avoid hydraulic dysfunction by becoming less vulnerable to cavitation (more negative P50). Two high-light-requiring species exhibited relatively low growth rates due to heavy herbivore damage. Contrary to expectations, shade-tolerant plants with relatively high resistance to hydraulic dysfunction and reduced herbivory damage were able to grow faster. These results suggest that during the initial phase of sapling establishment in gaps, species that were less vulnerable to cavitation and exhibited reduced herbivory damage had faster realized growth rates than less shade-tolerant species with higher potential growth rates. Finally, functional relationships between hydraulic traits and growth rate across species and treatments were maintained regardless of soil nutrient status.;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0829-318X;;WOS:000316751900007;23436182

In contrast, conservative growth and water relations in Pinus radiata resulted in longer periods of negative carbon balance and significant depletion of stored carbohydrates in all organs. The ongoing demand for carbohydrates from sustained respiration highlighted the role that duration of drought plays in facilitating carbohydrate consumption.Two drought strategies were revealed, differentiated by plant regulation of water status: plants maximized gas exchange, but were exposed to low water potentials and rapid hydraulic dysfunction; and tight regulation of gas exchange at the cost of carbohydrate depletion.

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of similar to 130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.;;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;d_c-58;;WOS:000312892500013;23431593

Results showed that the highest average basic density per stem for the six sites was 509.1 kg m(-3) and the lowest 448.9 kg m(-3). Basic density was significantly different (P < 0.05) among the sites. A significant effect of tree age on wood density was confirmed. Furthermore, the linear-mixed model was used to predict stem biomass. The allometric equation incorporating basic density at 10% of tree height (Model 4) was compared with the equation using only diameter at breast height and tree height as independent variables. The mean stem biomass predicted by Model 4 (16.5 kg tree(-1)) was not significantly different from the observed value (15.8 kg tree(-1)).

SG estimation can thus provide important information about the ecological characteristics of fossil assemblages. Since SG is also related to wood productivity, it can also inform about forest biomass and variation in terrestrial carbon stores over time. Here, we develop a straightforward method to predict SG based on wood anatomical traits that are frequently measured when fossil samples are described. We modeled the relationship of SG as a function of fiber and vessel traits in three extant Mexican communities (135 spp) and selected the best predictive equations. Fiber wall to lumen ratio was the variable most highly related with SG and was present in all the selected prediction models; this variable, together with vessel diameter, was part of the best model. In the validation datasets these models provided good estimates of SG both, at individual sample (overall R-2=0.63, varying from 0.44 to 0.84 in different localities) and average community levels. We applied these models to predict SG in three Mexican and one Peruvian fossil assemblages that ranged from Eocene to Miocene in age. To determine the reliability of the estimates, we compared them to observed SG from other extant communities and geographic regions. The estimates of two of the Mexican paleofloras were relatively high, most likely due to deficient preservation. In the other two fossil assemblages, El Cien Formation, Mexico and El Bosque Petrificado Piedra Chamana, Peru, the results were consistent with their inferred paleoenvironment and with the current understanding of the vegetation type they represented. The Peruvian paleoflora had relatively low SG suggesting comparatively higher growth rates and wood productivity, and relatively milder conditions compared to El Cien Formation paleoflora.

Its variability has been extensively described in narrow genetic backgrounds and in wide ranges of forest tree species, but little is known about the extent of natural genetic and phenotypic variability within species. This information is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary forces that have shaped this trait, and for the evaluation of its inclusion in breeding programs. We assessed juvenile wood density, leaf area, total aboveground biomass, and growth in six Pinus pinaster populations of different geographic origins (France, Spain, and Morocco) growing in a provenance-progeny trial. No genetic differentiation was found for wood density, whereas all other traits significantly differed between populations. Heritability of this trait was moderate, with a low additive genetic variance. For retrospective identification of the evolutionary forces acting on juvenile wood density, we compared the distribution of neutral markers (F (ST)) and quantitative genetic differentiation (Q (ST)). We found that Q (ST) was significantly lower than F (ST), suggesting evolutionary stasis. Furthermore, we did not detect any relationship between juvenile wood density and drought tolerance (resistance to cavitation), suggesting that this trait could not be used as a proxy for drought tolerance at the intraspecific level.;;;;;;;;;3;0;2;0;3;1385-0237;;WOS:000310833400008;

Many statistical techniques have been defined to classify species into groups, and a question is whether different techniques bring consistent classifications. In a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, five species classifications have been defined by different authors for the purpose of forest growth modelling but using different data sets and different statistical techniques. The correspondence between the five classifications was measured using four indices that are generalizations of existing indices to compare two classifications. A multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify associations between groups of different classifications. In a second step, two-table multivariate analyses were used to characterize the relationships between species classifications and eight species traits (consisting of seven populational traits and one functional trait). We evidenced a consensus on the potential size of trees: species were similarly clustered by the five classifications along this trait that is correlated to turnover rate. More surprisingly, no consensus was found for growth rate, nor wood density, traits that are correlated with light requirement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The models needed to be applicable as a part of a stand growth simulation system, which is based on growth models at the tree level. Data were collected from long-term thinning, thinning-fertilisation, and precommercial thinning experiments on mineral soil and drained peatland in southern and central Finland. The wood and tracheid properties were related to radial increment rate and distance from the pith outwards. An increased increment rate, caused by the different treatments and environmental conditions, resulted in similar types of changes in the wood and tracheid properties irrespective of the factors promoting radial increment. Although most of the average values of the properties were predicted unbiased, there were large random variations between individual trees and annual rings. The fixed parts of the models accounted for the following percentages of the variation: latewood proportion, 42%, wood density, 35%, tracheid length, 84%, tracheid width, 44%, and cell wall percentage, 29%. Incorporating the models for wood and tracheid properties into forest management planning systems enables estimates for the conversion of different silvicultural regimes into internal stem structure and wood quality.

The aims of this study were to (i) assess the importance of environmental factors relative to historical factors for tree species distributions in the semi-evergreen forests of the northern Congo basin; and to (ii) identify potential mechanisms explaining distribution patterns through a trait-based approach.Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the distribution patterns of 31 common tree species in an area of more than 700,000 km(2) spanning the borders of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo using forest inventory data from 56,445 0.5-ha plots. Spatial variation of environmental (climate, topography and geology) and historical factors (human disturbance) were quantified from maps and satellite records. Four key functional traits (leaf phenology, shade tolerance, wood density, and maximum growth rate) were extracted from the literature. The geological substrate was of major importance for the distribution of the focal species, while climate and past human disturbances had a significant but lesser impact. Species distribution patterns were significantly related to functional traits. Species associated with sandy soils typical of sandstone and alluvium were characterized by slow growth rates, shade tolerance, evergreen leaves, and high wood density, traits allowing persistence on resource-poor soils. In contrast, fast-growing pioneer species rarely occurred on sandy soils, except for Lophira alata.Conclusions/Significance: The results indicate strong environmental filtering due to differential soil resource availability across geological substrates. Additionally, long-term human disturbances in resource-rich areas may have accentuated the observed patterns of species and trait distributions. Trait differences across geological substrates imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for different conservation and management strategies.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;6;1932-6203;;WOS:000307823600012;22905127

Growth rates are variable around the tree circumference. This leads to differences in wood formation, which can be observed in the shape of the density profiles of the same tree ring measured in different radial directions. Due to this spatial variation in density profiles, we need a reliable method to determine an average profile, which preserves the common characteristics of the data. To this end, we developed a multiple interval-based curve alignment (MICA) procedure. It identifies characteristic points within the profiles such as minima, maxima and inflection points. These reference points are shifted gradually against each other within a proportionally defined baseline interval. Using our progressive alignment approach, we are able to calculate an average profile that represents very well the characteristics of all measured curves of a specific tree ring. We applied the procedure to get year-specific average profiles using various trees. This results in representative mean density profiles that preserve the density variations common to all aligned profiles. Individual noise is reduced, thereby enabling the analysis of the impact of weather variations on wood density.;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;1;0931-1890;;WOS:000306543600017;

These changes may continue during the old-growth life stages following the juvenile phase and are reflected in tree-ring properties such as growth increment, density or stable isotopes. We studied possible climate age effects in time series of several tree-ring parameters (ring width, wood density and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) of mature individuals from two age groups of and at two locations in Spain. The aim was to test whether age differences in trees in the old-growth life stages could lead to diverging climate responses. The results show some differences in response to climate between age groups at a monthly level, but most of these divergences are not significant for seasonal climate variables. Regardless of the age group, the main limiting climate factors constrained tree growth equally. Although our findings do not support the idea of an age-dependent response to climate that may lead to inaccurate climate reconstructions, further studies using tree-ring density and stable isotope series are urgently needed to verify the current results.;;;;;;;;;3;0;2;0;3;1612-4669;;WOS:000304102400004;

Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar.2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types.3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 x 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 x 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35% for seed mass to 77% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity.4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.";;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200007;

Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size.2. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts.3. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts.4. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density.5. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components.;;;;;;;;;17;3;19;1;21;0022-0477;;WOS:000302623200015;

Their characterisation can provide information about the relationship between environmental factors and eco-physiological processes during tree growth. This paper reports about the variability of anatomical traits and stable carbon isotopic composition along tree rings as resulting from the application of two different methodological approaches: (a) the separation of each ring into different regions (earlywood, latewood and IADF) and the comparison of anatomical and isotopic parameters measured in those specific sectors and (b) the analysis of such features in continuum along ring width. Moreover, different parameters of vessels (i.e. ecd-equivalent circle diameter, elongation, sphericity and convexity of vessel lumen) were considered to identify those more appropriate for the representation of intra-annual anatomical variations. The analysis was conducted on Arbutus unedo L. growing on the Elba Island (Italy); tree rings of this species form IADFs with features clearly responsive to the environmental conditions experienced during plant growth. Results showed that the first approach, although more suitable to obtain data for subsequent statistical comparisons and for the calculation of correlations with environmental parameters, suffers from elements of subjectivity due to the size and position of the selected tree-ring regions. The in continuum method allows a clearer identification of the variation of tree-ring properties along ring width. Regarding anatomical parameters, shape indexes were not suitable indicators of intra-annual variability. The overall analysis suggested that using both methodologies in synergy helps to gain complete information and avoid misleading interpretations of IADFs in tree rings.";;;;;;;;;9;0;9;0;9;0931-1890;;WOS:000301779200021;

Here, the phenotypic correlations between growth rate and the physical and mechanical properties of wood are investigated in two wild cherry plantations. X-ray microdensitometry was also applied to analyze the age-age correlations of wood density. It was shown that growth rate did not affect wood properties, and density was confirmed to be the trait that best represents the main properties of wood. The absence of relationships between wood density and growth rate was confirmed by densitometric analysis, although an increase of wood density with an increase of ring width was detected for very narrow rings (less than 3 mm wide). The average density at age 7 to 8 was observed to be highly correlated (r > 0.90) to the average density of a 19-year-old tree, allowing reliable estimation of the wood properties of older trees by early investigation of young trees.;;;;;;;;;5;0;2;0;5;1930-2126;;WOS:000307639900036;

To carry out the measurements, the test specimens were prepared from three stands and 3 logs at breast height, based on ASTM-D143 standard. The testing samples were cut along radial axis, from pith to bark, to determine annual ring width and physical properties, mature wood being used to measure mechanical strength characteristics. The results showed that oven-dry density, basic density, volumetric shrinkage and percentage of cell wall increased along radial direction from pith to bark, while ring width, maximum moisture content and porosity decreased. The average density at 12% moisture content was of 578.35 kg m(-3), the modulus of rupture (MOR) - of 73.77 MPa, modulus of elasticity (MOE) - of 6.73 GPa, and compression parallel to the grain - 43.82 MPa. The relationships between ring width and wood density, and between density at 12% moisture content and mechanical strength properties were determined by regression analyses. Positive relationships were found between density at 12% moisture content and mechanical strength properties, while the annual ring width showed a negative correlation with wood density. Overall, eldar pine trees growing in this site have low wood quality, according to the static quality and reference p value (ratio of static bending strength and compression strength parallel to the grain).;;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;2;0576-9787;;WOS:000303949400016;

Optimization of these two objectives will require a better understanding of how management regimes affect stand average wood density and carbon fraction. Two contrasting coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) sites were chosen for analysis of volume growth rates and tree stem carbon sequestration rates under two management systems-even-aged and multiaged-each with various treatments. A young plantation showed high volume increment and stem carbon sequestration rates in all treatments with the highest in the control plots. Control plots in the plantation had peak periodic volume increment of 75.6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and a maximum stem carbon sequestration rate of 16.08 tonnes C ha(-1) year(-1). The multiaged stand in contrast had the lowest volume and carbon increment in the control plots at 11.97 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.40 tonnes C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In both the management systems, significant differences were observed in the carbon fraction (mass carbon per unit mass dry wood) of heartwood (HW) and sapwood (SW) at 0.5385 and 0.5293, respectively, implying that increasing the ratio of HW to SW will result in higher average carbon fractions. Carbon density varied between management regimes with the highest values occurring in the multiaged stand indicating the potential for enhancement of carbon sequestration through silvicultural prescriptions. Utilization of standard carbon accounting practices resulted in a systematic underestimate of stand-level carbon stocks for both systems studied of 26 per cent in the even-aged stand and 27 per cent in the multiaged stand.;;;;;;;;;5;0;3;0;5;0015-752X;;WOS:000300238800009;

Functional traits are posited to explain interspecific differences in performance, but these relationships are difficult to describe for long-lived organisms such as trees, which exhibit strong ontogenetic changes in demographic rates. Here, we use a size-dependent model of tree growth to test the extent to which of 17 functional traits related to leaf and stem economics, adult stature and seed size predict the ontogenetic trajectory of tree growth.2. We used a Bayesian modelling framework to parameterize and contrast three size-dependent diameter growth models using 16 years of census data from 5524 individuals of 50 rain forest tree species: a size-dependent model, a size-dependent model with species-specific parameters and a size-dependent model based on functional traits.3. Most species showed clear hump-shaped ontogenetic growth trajectories and, across species, maximum growth rate varied nearly tenfold, from 0.58 to 5.51 mm year(-1). Most species attained their maximum growth at 60% of their maximum size, whereas the magnitude of ontogenetic changes in growth rate varied widely among species.4. The Trait-Model provided the best compromise between explained variance and model parsimony and needed considerably fewer parameters than the model with species terms.5. Stem economics and adult stature largely explained interspecific differences in growth strategy. Maximum absolute diameter growth rates increased with increasing adult stature and leaf delta(13)C and decreased with increasing wood density. Species with light wood had the greatest potential to modulate their growth, resulting in hump-shaped ontogenetic growth curves. Seed size and leaf economics, generally thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance, had no significant relationships with the growth parameters.6. Synthesis. Our modelling approach offers a promising way to link demographic parameters to their functional determinants and hence to predict growth trajectories in species-rich communities with little parameter inflation, bridging the gap between functional ecology and population demography.;;;;;;;;;24;0;24;0;24;0022-0477;;WOS:000296425000014;

We ask whether there is evidence of a trade-off between these traits and growth rate among species.Methods: Wood traits, including density, microfibril angle (MFA), and modulus of elasticity (MOE), ratio of tree height to stem diameter, and growth rate were investigated in mature trees of 15 co-occurring canopy species in a New Caledonian rainforest.Key results: In contrast to some studies, wood density did not correlate negatively with growth increment. Among angiosperms, wood density and MOE correlated positively with diameter-adjusted tree height, and MOE correlated positively with stem-diameter growth increment. Tall slender trees achieved high stiffness with high efficiency with respect to wood density, in part by low MFA, and with a higher diameter growth increment but a lower buckling safety factor. However, some tree species of a similar niche differed in whole-tree resistance to wind damage and achieved wood stiffness in different ways.Conclusions: There was no evidence of a growth-safety trade-off in these trees. In forests that regularly experience cyclones, there may be stronger selection for high wood density and/or stiffness in fast-growing trees of the upper canopy, with the potential growth trade-off amortized by access to the upper canopy and by other plant traits. Furthermore, decreasing wood density does not necessarily decrease resistance to wind damage, resistance being influenced by other characteristics including cell-level traits (e. g., MFA) and whole-plant architecture.;;;;;;;;;5;0;4;0;5;f_vr-22;;WOS:000296760500015;21984616

Most explanations for this trend so far support the hypothesis that carbon (C) gain becomes limited with age; though very few studies have directly assessed the relative reductions of C gain and C demand with tree age. It has also been suggested that drought enhances the effect of C gain limitation in trees. Here tests were carried out to determine whether C gain limitation is causing the growth decay with tree age, and whether drought accentuates its effect.Methods The balance between C gain and C demand across tree age and height ranges was estimated. For this, the concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in stems and roots of trees of different ages and heights was measured in the deciduous temperate species Nothofagus pumilio. An ontogenetic decrease in NSCs indicates support for C limitation. Furthermore, the importance of drought in altering the C balance with ontogeny was assessed by sampling the same species in Mediterranean and humid climate locations in the southern Andes of Chile. Wood density (WD) and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) were also determined to examine drought constraints on C gain.Key Results At both locations, it was effectively found that tree growth ultimately decreased with tree age and height. It was found, however, that NSC concentrations did not decrease with tree age or height when WD was considered, suggesting that C limitation is not the ultimate mechanism causing the age/height-related declining tree growth. delta(13)C decreased with tree age/height at the Mediterranean site only; drought effect increased with tree age/height, but this pattern was not mirrored by the levels of NSCs.Conclusions The results indicate that concentrations of C storage in N. pumilio trees do not decrease with tree age or height, and that reduced C assimilation due to summer drought does not alter this pattern.";;;;;;;;;7;0;7;0;7;0305-7364;;WOS:000295167900011;21852277

Despite our growing knowledge on the role of functional traits in structuring plant communities, few studies have tested their importance at large scales in the wet tropics. Here, we describe the distribution patterns of the most important West African rain forest timber species along the regional rainfall gradient and relate them to their functional traits. We found that the distribution patterns of 25 out of the 31 studied species (80%) were significantly related to mean annual rainfall. Shade tolerance and drought resistance were identified as the main strategy axes of variation. Wood density and leaf deciduousness emerged as the best predictor traits of species position along the rainfall gradient, explaining respectively 32 and 15 percent of the variation. Species traits tended to show stronger relationships with estimated optimum annual rainfall for each species than to the extreme rainfall conditions where they occur. The significant role of rainfall in shaping timber species distribution and the strong relationships between species traits and rainfall indicate that changes in climate, especially declining rainfall, could have strong effects on species composition and abundance in these tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;15;1;14;0;16;juin-06;;WOS:000294560000006;

Empirical data from stem cores of 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species demonstrate that wood C content is highly variable among co-occurring species, with an average (47.4+/-2.51% S. D.) significantly lower than widely assumed values. Prior published values have neglected to account for volatile C content of tropical woods. By comparing freeze- and oven-dried wood samples, we show that volatile C is non-negligible, and excluding the volatile fraction underestimates wood C content by 2.48+/-1.28% (S. D.) on average. Wood C content varied substantially among species (from 41.9-51.6%), but was neither strongly phylogenetically conserved, nor correlated to ecological (i.e. wood density, maximum tree height) or demographic traits (i.e. relative growth rate, mortality rate). Overall, assuming generic C fractions in tropical wood overestimates forest C stocks by similar to 3.3-5.3%, a non-trivial margin of error leading to overestimates of 4.1-6.8 Mg C ha(-1) in a 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In addition to addressing other sources of error in tropical forest C accounting, such as uncertainties in allometric models and belowground biomass, compilation and use of species-specific C fractions for tropical tree species would substantially improve both local and global estimates of terrestrial C stocks and fluxes.;;;;;;;;;31;1;26;0;32;1932-6203;;WOS:000294121300057;21858157

Tree allometry often varies among coexisting species of different maximum height (H(max)) in forests. Although shoot growth patterns directly influence overall tree architecture, the structures of current-year shoots at the tops of crowns have not been directly related to differences in tree allometry across species.2. I investigated height-dependent changes in structure and biomass allocation patterns in current-year shoots of four coexisting tree species differing in H(max) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The relative importance of total biomass, biomass allocation, shoot allometry, and shoot angle to vertical growth was quantified and compared with tree allometry.3. Height-dependent changes in total biomass of current-year shoots varied across species. In contrast, stem length per unit mass, shoot angle, and total leaf area per unit stem cross-sectional area decreased, and leaf mass per unit area increased with height in all species. Vertical growth rate consequently declined with increasing height in all species. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the primary determinant of declining vertical growth rate was change in stem length per unit mass; shoot angle was a secondary determinant. In contrast, increases in total shoot mass with height modulated declining vertical growth rates.4. Vertical growth rate was greater in two canopy species than in two sub-canopy species at given heights at the shoot level, and this pattern coincided with allometry between tree height and trunk diameter. In contrast, vertical growth rate was greater in sub-canopy species than in canopy species near their maximum heights. These patterns suggest that allometric differences between species may be useful for evaluating crown-development patterns, but not for estimating H(max) of species.";;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0269-8463;;WOS:000292330000006;

We calculated stage-specific developmental times, age-specific mortality and fecundity, stage-specific and total preadult mortality, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(0) = 0.21), the finite population growth rate (lambda = 1.23), the net reproductive rate (R(0) = 314.24), and the generation time (T = 21.45 wk). Elasticity analysis showed that the dominant life-history traits determining lambda were the adult female survival, and the survival of instar V nymphs (molting into adult females). Adult females dominated the stage-specific reproductive value, and the egg stage dominated the stable stage distribution (SSD). The damping ratio (rho = 1.11) suggests a relatively rapid period of recovery to a disturbed SSD.

We tested the following hypotheses concerning the 'inter-cataclysm' period on a remote Polynesian island: (1) tree turnover would be high and recruitment rates would be significantly higher than mortality; (2) low-intensity disturbance would result in a marginal increase in tree mortality in the short term; (3) turnover would vary among species and would be associated with plant traits linked to differences in life history; and (4) mortality and recruitment events would be spatially non-random.Location Tutuila, a volcanic island in the Samoan Archipelago, Polynesia.Methods We censused the tree (stem diameter >= 10 cm) community in 3.9 ha of tropical forest three times over a 10-year period, 1998-2008. We calculated annual mortality, recruitment and turnover rates for 36 tree species. We tested for non-random spatial patterns and predictors of mortality, and non-random spatial patterns of tree recruitment. A 2004 cyclone passing within 400 km allowed us to measure the effects of a non-cataclysmic disturbance on vital rates.Results Annual turnover was 2.8% and annual recruitment was 3.6%; these are some of the highest rates in the tropics, and likely to be a response to a cyclone that passed < 50 km from Tutuila in 1991. Species turnover rates over 10 years were negatively correlated with wood specific gravity, and positively correlated with annual stem diameter increment. Mortality was spatially aggregated, and a function of site, species and an individual's growth rate. Recruitment was highest on ground with low slope. The low-magnitude cyclone disturbance in 2004 defoliated 29% of all trees, but killed only 1.8% of trees immediately and increased annual mortality over 5 years by 0.7%.Main conclusions The inter-cataclysm period on Tutuila is characterized by frequent, low-amplitude disturbances that promote high rates of tree recruitment and create a dynamic, non-equilibrium or disturbed island disequilibrium tree community. Species with low wood density and fast growth rates have enhanced opportunities for recruitment between cataclysms, but also higher probabilities of dying. Our results suggest that increases in the frequency of cyclone activity could shift relative abundances towards disturbance-specialist species and new forest turnover rates.";;;;;;;;;6;0;6;0;7;0305-0270;;WOS:000292695200002;

The correlations between growth traits and Pilodyn pin penetration were positive, ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and therefore unfavorable as lower wood density will be associated with higher values of Pilodyn pin penetration and improved growth rate.

All species except Pseudosamanea guachapele reduced leaf physiological function between the wet and dry seasons. The contrasting severity of seasonal drought stress at the study sites constrained growth rates and photosynthetic characteristics differently. Variation of photosynthetic characteristics at the species level was high, particularly in the dry season. Faster growing species at the less seasonal site, Terminalia amazonia, Inga punctata, Colubrina glandulosa, and Acacia mangium, exhibited a greater adaptive capacity than the other species to down-regulate leaf photosynthesis between seasons. As the dry season was more severe at the more seasonal site, most species strongly reduced physiological function regardless of relative growth rates, except two species (Tectona grandis and P. guachapele) with widespread distributions and relatively high drought tolerance. Our results underscore the need to consider seasonal drought tolerance when selecting tree species for specific reforestation sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.7. Synthesis. Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.;;;;;;;;;18;0;17;0;18;0022-0477;;WOS:000282978100020;

Wood specific gravity of chir pine before and after removal of extractives from wood increment cores was assessed from a 22-years-old progeny test in Himachal Pradesh, India. These values averaged 0.433 and 0.425, respectively. A large amount of genetic variation among the 58 half-sib families was found as indicated by range of values, additive coefficient of variation, variance estimates and narrow-sense heritability values for these traits. Moisture and extractive content averaged 86.259% of oven-dry weight and 2.003% of extractive-free oven-dry weight, respectively. Wood extractive content was highly variable and the family differences were highly heritable (h (f) (2) = 0.5831). There was wide variability in moisture content, but a large portion of it was due to environmental or non-additive component of genetic variation. Heritability on family mean basis was found to be lower than that on individual tree basis for each trait. Estimated gain in specific gravity resulting from 30 to 50% family selection ranged from 0.0080 to 0.0127. Growth data and specific gravity were not significantly correlated implying that selection for higher growth rate would not necessarily result in reduction in wood specific gravity in chir pine.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0169-4286;;WOS:000280650100008;

Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.;;;;;;;;;14;0;14;0;14;0021-8901;;WOS:000279405100012;

Selection of species for solid wood production in southern China. Seven eucalypt species and Acacia mangium from a species trial in southern China were assessed for growth, stem form and wood properties at age 6 years. Differences in growth were highly significant for mean tree volume with the order Eucalyptus urophylla > E. cloeziana > A. mangium > E. grandis > E. urophylla x grandis > E. saligna > E. pellita > E. torelliana. There were also significant differences between species for stem form, height to first live branch and stem straightness. Positive correlations were found between height to first live branch and stem straightness. Pilodyn was used to assess variation in wood density and Fakopp was used to indirectly assess modulus of elasticity (MOE). Eucalyptus cloeziana had the highest wood density and MOE, while E. grandis had the lowest wood density and E. torelliana, the lowest MOE. With regard to growth, stem form and wood properties at age 6 years, the order of species for the purpose of conversion of logs into solid wood products was E. cloeziana > E. urophylla x grandis > E. urophylla > E. pellita > A. mangium > E. grandis > E. saligna > E. torelliana.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0128-1283;;WOS:000280653200010;

Wood density is considered a key functional trait influencing the growth and survival of woody plants and has been shown to be related to a slow-fast rate-of-living continuum. Wood density is, however, an emergent trait arising from several vascular properties of wood, including the diameter and frequency of xylem conduits.2. We aimed to test the hypotheses that there is a set of inter-related trade-offs linked to the different functions of wood, that these trade-offs have direct consequences for tree growth and survival and that these trade-offs underlie the observed correlations between wood density and demographic rates. We evaluated the covariation between xylem anatomical traits among woody species of New Zealand and whether that covariation had the potential to constrain variation in wood density and demographic rates.3. Several xylem traits were strongly correlated with each other, but wood density was not correlated with any of them. We also found no significant relationships between wood density and growth or mortality rate. Instead, growth was strongly related to xylem traits associated with hydraulic capacity (conduit diameter and a conductivity index) and to maximum height, whereas mortality rate was strongly correlated only with maximum height. The diameter and frequency of conduits exhibited a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, which restricted variation in wood density and growth rate, but not mortality rate.4. Our results suggest, for woody species in New Zealand, that growth rate is more closely linked to xylem traits determining hydraulic conductance, rather than wood density. We also found no evidence that denser woods conferred higher survival, or that risk of cavitation caused by wide conduits increased mortality.5. In summary, we found little support for the idea that wood density is a good proxy for position along a fast-slow rate-of-living continuum. Instead, the strong, negative relationship between vessel diameter and frequency may constrain the realized diversity of demographic niches of tree species in New Zealand. Trade-offs in function therefore have the potential to shape functional diversity and ecology of forest communities by linking selection on structure and function to population-level dynamics.;;;;;;;;;28;0;27;0;29;0269-8463;;WOS:000274952600002;

For a 10 300 km(2) semiarid portion of Gregory National Park, in the present paper we describe (1) components of the contemporary fire regime for 1998-2008, on the basis of assessments derived from Landsat and MODIS imagery, (2) for the same period, the population dynamics, and characteristic fine-fuel loads associated with Acacia shirleyi Maiden (lancewood), an obligate seeder tree species occurring in dense monodominant stands, and (3) the fire responses of woody species, and fine-fuel dynamics, sampled in 41 plots comprising shrubby open-woodland over spinifex hummock grassland. While rain-year (July-June) rainfall was consistently reliable over the study period, annual fire extent fluctuated markedly, with an average of 29% being fire affected, mostly in the latter part of the year under relatively harsh fire-climate conditions. Collectively, such conditions facilitated short fire-return intervals, with 30% of the study area experiencing a repeat fire within 1 year, and 80% experiencing a repeat fire within 3 years. Fine fuels associated with the interior of lancewood thickets were characteristically small (<1 t ha(-1)). Fine fuels dominated by spinifex (Triodia spp.) were found to accumulate at rates equivalent to those observed under higher-rainfall conditions. Stand boundaries of A. shirleyi faired poorly under prevailing fire regimes over the study period; in 16 plots, juvenile density declined 62%, and adult stem density and basal area declined by 53% and 40%, respectively. Although the maturation (primary juvenile) period of A. shirleyi is incompletely known, assembled growth rate and phenology data indicated that it is typically >10 years. Of 133 woody species sampled, all trees (n = 26), with the exception of A. shirleyi, were resprouters, and 58% of all shrub species (n = 105) were obligate seeders, with observed primary juvenile periods <5 years. Assembled data generally supported observations made from other northern Australian studies concerning the responses of fire-sensitive woody taxa in rugged, sandstone-derived landscapes, and illustrated the enormous challenges facing ecologically sustainable fire management in such settings.

The experiment comprised datasets of unthinned control trees and trees of four thinning treatments, in which thinning operations of different intensities were carried out. These thinning operations were applied either once, three, or five times over the course of the stand rotation. Thinning intensities varied from 0% to 60% based on the stand basal area (BA) before thinning: (A) 5 x 20% (i.e., 20% of the BA removed five times); (B) 3 x 40% (i.e., 40% of the BA removed three times); (C) 1 x 60% (i.e., 60% of the BA removed once); and (D) 5 x 40% (i.e., 40% of the BA removed five times). Altogether 60 trees that were 67 years old were sampled 38 years after the treatment onset. Radial growth rate, wood density, tracheid properties, and the chemical composition of wood were studied in detail. All four thinning treatments increased growth rate and decreased wood density; however, treatment D showed the greatest change. Single, heavy thinning in treatment C resulted in unfavourable intra-stem variation in ring width and wood density. No significant differences in tracheid properties and wood chemistry were found between the treatments. We conclude that only a remarkable increase in growth rate would induce detrimental changes in tracheid properties and wood chemistry in the context of thinning.";;;;;;;;;2;0;0;0;2;0018-3830;;WOS:000273912800011;

Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density.Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk.Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field.

Karst.). The measurements cover a wide range of tree age from juvenile wood to very mature wood (<120 years) as well as large tree diameters (up to >60 cm). Fibre length was measured in three different tree heights separately for earlywood and the according latewood. The databases include the whole spectrum of log qualities that are classified in the Austrian grading rules (FHP 2006). Non-linear regression (NLR) models were applied to investigate the correlation between tracheid length and tree age, cambial age or radial distance from pith at different tree heights.Trend lines of the tracheid length regarding tree age, cambial age, tree height and inter-annual variation were developed achieving high correlation coefficients up to r(2) = 0.78. The applied function to describe the tracheid length trend is based on a logarithmic curve (Bailey 1920). Due to the proposed additional terms the function allows for a steeper increase of fibre length in the juvenile growth phase as well a culmination/decrease at high age. The influence of log qualities (grades) on the fibre length was illustrated.The study gives a deeper insight on tracheid cell morphology in coniferous trees and can be applied to select the most appropriate raw material for specific wood, pulp and paper products.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1336-4561;;WOS:000287643700001;

The trial comprised four replicates per treatment with 5 x 5 tree clonal plots. Height was measured at ages one and two years, and diameter at breast height over bark at age 11 years. Increment cores at breast height were obtained from one fast-and one slow-growing ramet within each clonal plot to determine corewood basic density, near infrared-predicted kraft pulp yield, cellulose content, and extractives content. No significant interactions among main treatments were detected for any of the growth-or wood-property traits. Nitrogen application increased cellulose content (p < 0.05). Phosphorus application significantly increased diameter (p < 0.01), but resulted in lower wood density (p < 0.001).

Pulpwood production per hectare (calculated from plot volume, mean whole-tree adjusted density and mean plot kraft pulp yield) indicated that: (i) the choice of germplasm had a much larger effect on plantation profitability than did the starter fertiliser application; and (ii) that failure to account for adverse changes in wood properties in calculating pulp fibre production would result in over-estimation of the gain in pulp production due to starter phosphorus application by up to 0.6 t/ha or 20% per 12 year rotation.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI201100027173;

In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the plant-water relationships of Jotropha seedlings from different accessions under different levels of drought stress. There was little difference in plant-water relations between accessions. Drought significantly reduced leaf area, biomass and relative growth rate, but had no effect on specific leaf area, daily range in leaf water potential, leaf water content, transpiration efficiency or aboveground biomass water productivity, corrected for atmospheric conditions. Stem wood density was equally low (0.26 g cm(-3)) for all treatments. Stem water content was lowest for dry treatment seedlings. Based on these results, Jatropha could be characterized as a stem-succulent tree. In contrast to other stem-succulent deciduous trees, leaves were not shed immediately after the seedlings were confronted with drought. Instead, at the onset of drought, leaves with a higher adaxial stomatal density were formed, after which leaves were only gradually shed. The role of the succulent stem in the water economy of Jatropha was confined to balancing the small water losses of the leaves during drought. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, fast growth rates and large size entail reduced investment in defenses, lower wood density and mechanical strength, increased hydraulic resistance as well as problems with down-regulation of growth during periods of stress, all of which may decrease tree longevity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between longevity and growth rates of trees and quantified effects of spatial environmental variation (elevation, slope steepness, aspect, soil depth) on tree longevity. Radial growth rates and longevities were determined from tree-ring samples of 161 dead trees from three conifer species in subalpine forests of the Colorado Rocky Mountains (Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii) and the Swiss Alps (Picea abies). For all three species, we found an apparent tradeoff between growth rate to the age of 50 years and longevity (i.e. fast early growth is associated with decreased longevity). This association was particularly pronounced for larger P. engelmannii and P. abies, which attained canopy size, however, there were also significant effects for smaller P. engelmannii and P. abies. For the more shade-tolerant A. lasiocarpa, tree size did not have any effect. Among the abiotic variables tested only northerly aspect significantly favored longevity of A. lasiocarpa and P. engelmannii. Trees growing on south-facing aspects probably experience greater water deficits leading to premature tree death, and/or shorter life spans may reflect shorter fire intervals on these more xeric aspects. Empirical evidence from other studies has shown that global warming affects growth rates of trees over large spatial and temporal scales. For moist-cool subalpine forests, we hypothesize that the higher growth rates associated with global warming may in turn result in reduced tree longevity and more rapid turnover rates.;;;;;;;;;33;0;30;0;34;0030-1299;;WOS:000268535300003;

This study assesses genetic and phenotypic correlation between growth, wood density components, lignin content and mechanical traits (radial modulus of elasticity and radial modulus of rupture) of 46 half sib families from a progeny trail located in Leiria, Portugal, originated from seed collected in a clonal seed orchard. A total of 552 seventeen-years-old trees (about half of full rotation age) were sampled at 2 m height. Height measured at 12 years old presented a higher genetic control (h(2) = 0.34) relatively to DBH, measured at 12 and 17 years old respectively (h(2) = 0.17 and h(2) = 0.15). The results of this study also showed that DEIH growth is more dependent on latewood components than earlywood components and that higher growth in Mediterranean regions can be due to an increase of the period of latewood formation. Further, we can conclude genetic selection based on growth will not result in a decrease of wood density, will not affect the occurrence of spiral grain, and is possible to obtain an increase in the radial modulus of elasticity. The present study also showed that it is possible to select for increased growth with lower lignin proportion. Results also suggest that selection for growth at 12 years will probably not affect negatively the wood properties at 17 years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With this re-scaled data it was possible to evaluate how water availability and temperature affected wood density, microfibril angle (MFA) and fibre and vessel transverse dimensions in irrigated and non-irrigated trees.Wood density, fibre radial diameter and MFA were sensitive to water availability. Wood density increased and fibre radial diameter decreased in response to reduced water availability. When high water availability was maintained, wood density was negatively correlated with temperature. Together, temperature and soil matric potential explained about 60% of temporal variation in wood density variation. In contrast MFA was not related to temperature but decreased with increasing water stress. Slower growing trees also had lower MFA than faster growing trees. Slower growing trees had a larger number of vessels per unit area of wood than faster growing trees within this even aged stand. However, vessel radius to the 4th power was significantly higher in faster growing trees than in slower growing trees.Overall, E. globulus wood properties were sensitive to temporal changes in environmental conditions (particularly water availability) and associated growth rates.

Samples of E grandis were collected from four plantations in different latitude divisions, including tropical and subtropical Brazil and subtropical Argentina. Various xylem qualities were measured and related to the lateral growth rate. Lateral growth rate did not significantly affect the longitudinal released strain of the surface growth stresses or the xylem density at any of the sampling sites. Higher lateral growth rate. higher values of xylem density, and lower absolute values of the released strain were observed in plantations closer to the equator. Higher growth rates in tropical climate promote longer fiber length. In subtropical plantations. smaller diameter trees will produce tension wood with smaller microfibril angles.

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.;;;;;;;;;319;4;299;0;331;1461-023X;;WOS:000264067600008;19243406

Logistic regression was used to relate mode of death to tree diameter, relative growth rate and wood density.Frequency of multiple death events was higher in high-mortality northwestern (NW) than in low-mortality northeastern (NE) Amazonia, but these events were small, averaging two trees killed per multiple death event. Breakage was the dominant known mode of death (51 +/- 8%) in the NW, with half of fatal breakages caused by other treefalls or breakages. Small and slow-growing trees were more prone to breaking than uprooting. In NE Amazonia, the dominant known mode of death was standing (48 +/- 10%); these trees tended to be relatively large and slow growing. Broken trees in NE forests have a lower wood density than uprooted trees.The major mortality mechanisms differ in the two regions. In the NW it involves an interaction between physiological failure and mechanical failure (small size, slow growth and broken mode). In the NE it is mainly driven by physiological failure (large size, slow growth and standing mode).

One species increasingly being planted both in Australia and overseas is Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden. For a species to be considered suitable for forestry, criteria to be met include successful establishment, growth and suitability for end use, be that pulp, solid wood or veneer production.Historic data from E. dunnii plantations aged from 3 to 34 y were reviewed. Growth and wood quality using a range of non-destructive and destructive measurements are reported. Eucalyptus dunnii typically grew equally well as some alternative species, although species ranking was affected by the growing site. Eucalyptus dunnii produced high-quality wood chips with average pulp yield from three NSW plantations aged 8-10 y of 53% and 265 kg m(-3). This yield is comparable with that of 10-y-old E. globulus plantation material from Tasmania. Wood density increased with tree age from about 500 kg m(-3) at age 10 y to 600 kg m-3 at age 25 y, and more slowly beyond that age. Many solid-wood quality traits such as hardness and strength could be positively correlated with both tree age and basic density. This has implications for the timber industry as it is intended that plantation trees will be harvested at Younger ages than native forest trees, but wood quality in such younger material may not satisfy minimum product performance requirements. However, trees selected for higher density achieved strength group ratings at age 9 y that Would normally be achieved at age 25-30 y. It is not known if similar improvements can be made in other wood quality traits. Quality traits requiring further examination are growth stresses and endsplitting of logs, and shrinkage of sawn timber. Collapse (reversible shrinkage) and non-reversible shrinkage are positively related to wood density, but a greater concern is the high ratio of tangential shrinkage compared to radial shrinkage. This ratio, which can be 2.5 or greater in E. dunnii, leads to excessive distortion in sawn material. It may be possible to reduce overall wood shrinkage and the ratio of tangential to radial shrinkage, as well as other unfavourable wood quality traits, through genetic selection as these traits in related eucalypts (e.g. blackbutt, E. pilularis) are heritable.;;;;;;;;;7;0;4;0;7;avr-58;;WOS:000264279700002;

Water availability is the main determinant of species' distribution in lowland tropical forests. Species' occurrence along water availability gradients depends on their ability to tolerate drought.2. To identify species' traits underlying drought-tolerance we excavated first year seedlings of 62 dry and moist forest tree species at the onset of the dry season. We evaluate how morphological seedling traits differ between forests, and whether functional groups of species can be identified based on trait relations. We also compare seedling traits along independent axes of drought and shade-tolerance to assess a hypothesized trade-off.3. Seedlings of dry forest species improve water foraging capacity in deep soil layers by an increased below-ground biomass allocation and by having deep roots. They minimize the risk of cavitation by making dense stems, and reduce transpiration by producing less leaf tissue. Moist forest seedlings have large leaf areas and a greater above-ground biomass, to maximize light interception, and long, cheap, branched root systems, to increase water and nutrient capture.4. Associations among seedling traits reveal three major drought strategies: (i) evergreen drought-tolerant species have high biomass investment in enduring organs, minimize cavitation and minimize transpiration to persist under dry conditions; (ii) drought-avoiding species maximize resource capture during a limited growing season and then avoid stress with a deciduous leaf habit in the dry season; (iii) drought-intolerant species maximize both below-and above-ground resource capture to increase competitiveness for light, but are consequently precluded from dry habitats.5. We found no direct trade-off between drought-and shade-tolerance, because they depend largely on different morphological adaptations. Drought-tolerance is supported by a high biomass investment to the root system, whereas shade-tolerance is mainly promoted by a low growth rate and low SLA.6. Synthesis. We conclude that there are three general adaptation strategies of drought-tolerance, which seemingly hold true across biomes and for different life forms. Drought-and shade-tolerance are largely independent from one another, suggesting a high potential for niche differentiation, as species' specialization can occur at different combinations of water and light availability.";;;;;;;;;63;3;60;3;68;0022-0477;;WOS:000263302000012;

It is also valuable in understanding tree responses to environment to optimise forest management. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13), wood density and microfibril angle (MFA) are potentially useful wood property parameters for these purposes. The goal of this study was to understand how delta C-13 varied over time in response to cycles of soil drying and wetting and to variation in temperature in Eucalyptus nitens Deane & Maiden, in concert with wood density and MFA. delta C-13 increases did not necessarily occur when water stress was highest, but, rather, when it was relieved. Our hypothesis is that this was a result of the use of previously fixed carbohydrate reserves when growth and metabolic activity was resumed after a period of dormancy. MFA in particular showed concomitant temporal variation with delta C-13. A peak in delta C-13 may not coincide temporally with an increase in water stress, but with a decrease, when higher growth rates enable the final incorporation of earlier stored photosynthate into mature wood. This has implications for using delta C-13 as a tool to understand past environmental conditions using radial measurements of wood properties. However, interpreting this data with other wood properties may be helpful for understanding past tree responses.;;;;;;;;;3;0;2;0;3;1445-4408;;WOS:000262238900001;

This work has focused on the intra-annual stem growth of poplar compared with the carbon available for xylogenesis processes in cambium and outer wood. The major stages of xylem production and differentiation in two poplar genotypes with different growth performances were considered. Monitoring of stem growth and leaf phenology combined with starch, nonstructural soluble sugars and water content in the stem was conducted from February to November 2006 in Populus x canadensis Moench 'I-214' and Populus deltoides Marsh. 'Dvina'. Anatomical analyses of wood formation were performed by measuring the width of the zones with differentiating and mature xylem. At the end of the growing period, wood density was assessed by microdensity analyses. Xylem differentiation at the top of the tree started at the beginning of April for both genotypes and proceeded down the stem at about 0.5 m day(-1), occurring almost at the same time as leaf opening. The rate of growth and wood density was superior in Dvina, but this higher productivity could not be explained by differences in the number of cambial initials and the duration of xylogenesis. However, the most productive poplar genotype showed higher glucose, fructose and sucrose content in the outer wood. The nonstructural soluble sugars available in the cambial zone followed the intra-annual pattern of xylem formation, with a higher concentration when the growth rate was maximum. The accumulations of nonstructural soluble sugars at a certain time during stem growth corresponded with a higher carbon availability to the actively growing meristems in the stem.;;;;;;;;;32;4;29;0;35;0829-318X;;WOS:000270219200003;19696052

Do tree species differ in their susceptibility to lianas? 2. What host tree traits (branch-free bole height, growth rate, bark type, leaf length and adult stature) are correlated with the susceptibility of tree species to lianas infesting the trunk and the crown? 3. To what extent do spatial variables (proximity to liana-infested trees and the light environment of the tree crown) affect the likelihood of liana infestation? 4. Are spatial variables or tree traits relatively more important in influencing the susceptibility of trees to lianas? We address all questions separately for trunk and crown infestation.Location: Tambopata Nature Reserve, Peru.Methods: We collected information on liana infestation, tree morphological traits, growth, light-environment and position for 3675 trees in seven 1-ha permanent sample plots. We separated trunk from crown infestation and used correlation and logistic regression analyses for tree species and individual tree-level analyses, respectively.Results: Half of all trees were colonised by at least one liana. Of 41 relatively common dicot tree species, at least five have significantly greater and three significantly lower crown infestation rates than expected by chance. Trunk and crown infestation are influenced by different host traits - trunk infestation was only affected by bark type, while crown infestation is reduced when trees are fast-growing, tall, have low-density wood, long branch-free boles and long leaves. The likelihood of both trunk and crown infestation increases for trees growing in close proximity to another liana-infested tree, but is invariant with the light environment of tree crowns.Conclusion: Crown and trunk infestation have not been properly distinguished before; it is important to do so as the factors determining the different modes of infestation differ fundamentally. The association between crown infestation and tree traits suggests that increases in liana dominance in Amazonian forests could cause changes in forest composition, including favouring faster growing tree species with low density wood, potentially reducing the carbon stored by mature forests.";;;;;;;;;17;0;15;2;18;1100-9233;;WOS:000264001900002;

However, few studies have examined these trade-offs from the perspective of whole-plant biomass gain of adult trees. We compared tree-level annual diameter increments and annual above-ground biomass (AGB) increments in eight long-term plots in hyper-diverse northwest Amazonia to wood density (rho; a proxy for shade tolerance), whilst also controlling for resource supply (light and soil fertility). rho and annual diameter increment were negatively related, confirming expected differences in allocation associated with shade tolerance, such that light-demanding species allocate a greater proportion of carbon to diameter gain at the expense of woody tissue density. However, contrary to expectations, we found a positive relationship between rho and annual AGB increment in more fertile sites, although AGB gain did not differ significantly with rho class on low-fertility sites. Whole-plant carbon gain may be greater in shade-tolerant species due to higher total leaf area, despite lower leaf-level carbon assimilation rates. Alternatively, rates of carbon loss may be higher in more light-demanding species: higher rates of litterfall, respiration or allocation to roots, are all plausible mechanisms. However, the relationships between rho and AGB and diameter increments were weak; resource availability always exerted a stronger influence on tree growth rates.";;;;;;;;;12;1;9;0;13;0029-8549;;WOS:000260856300013;18853192

These components have important consequences for the construction costs, strength and stability of trees. Here, the importance of stem components for sapling growth and survival in the field was investigated, and then these stem components were related to two important life history axes of variation: the light requirements for regeneration and the adult stature of the species.Methods Stem fractions of wood, gas and water were determined for saplings and adults of respectively 30 and 58 Bolivian tropical moist-forest species. Sapling height growth and survival were monitored for 2 years in the field as indicators of sapling performance.Key Results Sapling stems consisted of 26 % wood (range 7-36 % for species), 59 % water (range 49-88 %), and 15 % gas (range 0-38 %) per unit volume. The wood fraction was the only determinant of sapling performance and was correlated with increased survival and decreased growth rate across species. The wood fraction decreased with light requirements of the species, probably because a high wood fraction protects shade-tolerant species against pathogens and falling debris. The gas fraction increased with the light requirements and adult stature of the species; probably as an aid in realizing a rapid height growth and accessing the canopy in the case of light-demanding species, and for rapidly attaining stability and a large reproductive size in the case of tall species. The water fraction was not correlated with the life history variation of tree species, probably because it leads to increased stem loading and decreased stability.Conclusions The wood fraction might partially explain the growth-survival trade-off that has been found across tropical tree species. The wood and gas fractions are closely related to the regeneration light requirements of the species. Tall species have a high gas fraction, probably not only because gas is a cheap filler, but also because it might lead to an increased stability of these tall trees.";;;;;;;;;27;0;25;0;27;0305-7364;;WOS:000258471100008;18573862

Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. in both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species.

Evidence from five Neotropical forests;;;;;;;;ECOLOGY;;;;89;7;;;1908;1920;;10.1890/07-0207.1;;;juil-08;2008;A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests.There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival.Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.;;;;;;;;;124;4;122;0;130;d_c-58;;WOS:000258007500013;18705377

Two approximately 20-year-old Eucalyptus grandis clonal trials at Bergvliet plantation were sampled. The first trial (Trial A) consisted of clones of eight ortets (genotypes) specifically selected for their widely different propensities to develop end splitting. The second trial (Trial B) consisted of 80 clones and one seedling control. From the latter trial 15 clones were selected in such a manner that they constituted three groups of clones representing a combination of high- and low-volume producers and, among the high-volume producers, clones exhibiting high and low propensities towards end splitting. The fourth group represented the seedling control. Trial A showed highly significant clonal differences in splitting, basic wood density, as well as its pith-to-bark gradient. No relationship of splitting with differences in growth rate, density or density gradient was found. The clones derived from the low- and high-splitting ortets maintained their general statuses as low and high splitters over a considerable period of time, but some of the individual clones did not reflect the performance of the ortets from which they were derived. Trial B revealed that clones classified as good-volume producers at the age of 65 months still outperformed the clones classified as low-volume producers approximately 15 years later. No significant differences in average wood density between the groups of clones studied was found, irrespective of differences in growth rate and degree of splitting, but trees from the slow-growing group of clones were significantly more variable across the radius in average wood density. The outcome of both trials confirmed results of many previous studies on this species, in that rapid and uniform growth has no significant detrimental effect on wood density or its rate of change across the radius of the tree. It may, in fact, be associated with increased uniformity from pith to bark with increasing age, sometimes resulting in slightly increased overall wood density.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;1;1;2070-2620;;WOS:000259225700005;

These two attributes are expected to be negatively correlated, because investment of biomass in structural support (conferring resistance) results in trees exhibiting high wood densities and slow growth rates, and vice versa. We examined species' responses to disturbance caused by a severe tropical cyclone to test this hypothesized trade-off. We assessed cyclone damage in six species in three Mabi rainforest fragments on the Atherton Tablelands. Species differed in the proportion of individuals within four damage categories (minor damage, severe branch damage, snapped, uprooted). Resistance was positively related to wood density. We found a positive correlation between the proportion of trees experiencing minor damage only and wood density, supporting the hypothesized association between resistance and mechanical strength. Among the subset of trees in which stems snapped, rates of resprouting differed between species and were highest in low wood density species and lowest in species with highest wood density. Resilience, characterized as the ability to recover biomass following disturbance and estimated as growth rate standardized for stem diameter at breast height (g day(-1) . mm(-1)), was negatively related to wood density. Thus, species with low wood densities were more likely to suffer stem and branch damage owing to cyclonic winds, but also demonstrated highest resprouting and fastest responses in terms of redeveloping biomass in the 8 months following disturbance. This suggests that a species' position along the resistance-resilience spectrum can be predicted by mean wood density, which may allow managers to predict species' responses to future cyclones. Our findings also provide mechanistic evidence for the 'direct regeneration' model of post-cyclone succession, where response is characterized by resprouting and species composition is unchanged.;;;;;;;;;30;2;29;0;33;1442-9985;;WOS:000255643500007;

Don) (totara), a highly valued, naturally-durable softwood tree species, is widely distributed in indigenous lowland forest throughout New Zealand. As harvesting from natural forests has declined there has been increasing interest in planting and managing P. totara for timber production. Seed from 36 provenances was collected from throughout the species' natural range (latitude 35 degrees 21'-45 degrees 52) in 1985, and a resulting field trial planted on an open, frost-free coastal site near Auckland at latitude 36 degrees was assessed for growth and tree form in 1994 and 1999. Survival of all but one provenance exceeded 80%, with an overall average height of 5.5 in and diameter at breast height (DBH) of 8.6 cm. Provenance mean height and DBH varied significantly from 4.8-6.5 in and 6.9-11.2 cm, respectively, I I years after planting. Height was correlated with latitude and mean summer temperature of site of origin (r = -0.58, 0.54), with a similar trend apparent at the end of the nursery phase three years after sowing of seed. Stem form, assessed on height to first double leader, was also negatively correlated (r = -0.49) with latitude, although less closely than height. The seedlots from northern latitudes tended to grow faster and have better stem form than seedlots from southern latitudes, suggesting that genetic factors related to seed source are influencing growth of P. totara I I years after planting. In contrast, there was no correlation of provenance mean heights with altitude which may reflect the fact that seed dispersal of P. totara is by birds which can spread seed over wide altitudinal ranges within relatively short distances. However, the wide latitudinal and thus climatic range has resulted in some genetic differentiation of local populations.The study indicates that there is scope for selection for both growth rate and stem form of P. totara for production of improved seed for planting. There were no significant correlations found between wood density sampled in 1999, with geographical and growth variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The variation in anatomical and hydraulic characteristics of branches was considered from three perspectives: vertically within a crown (lower, middle and upper crown), radially along main branches (proximal, middle and distal part), and with respect to branch orders (first-, second- and third-order branches). Hydraulically weighted mean diameter of vessels (D (h)) and theoretical specific conductivity of the xylem (k (t)) exhibited no vertical trend within the tree crown, whereas leaf-specific conductivity of the xylem (LSCt) decreased acropetally. Variation in LSCt was governed by sapwood area to leaf area ratio (Huber value) rather than by changes in xylem anatomy. The acropetal increase in soil-to-leaf conductance (G (T)) within the birch canopy is attributable to longer path length within the lower-crown branches and higher hydraulic resistance of the shade leaves. D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, while vessel density (VD) and relative area of vessel lumina (VA) increased distally along main branches. A strong negative relationship between vessel diameter and VD implies a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability of xylem. D (h) and VD combined explained 85.4% of the total variation of k (t) in the regression model applied to the whole data set. Xylem in fast-growing branches (primary branches) had greater area of vessel lumina per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood, resulting in a positive relationship between branch radial growth rate and k (t). D (h), k (t) and LSCt decreased, whereas VD increased with increasing branch order. This pattern promotes the hydraulic dominance of primary branches over the secondary branches and their dominance over tertiary branches. In this way crown architecture contributes to preferential water flow along the main axes, potentially providing better water supply for the branch apical bud and foliage located in the outer, better-insolated part of the crown.;;;;;;;;;14;1;12;0;15;0931-1890;;WOS:000254240300009;

Tree mortality is an important process in forest ecology. We explored the extent to which tropical tree death is a predictable outcome of taxon and individual level properties by means of mixed-species logistic regression, for trees >= 10 cm in diameter. We worked in two lowland forest regions with markedly different floristic composition and dynamic regimes - the high wood density, low-mortality northeastern (NE) Amazon (in eastern Venezuela), and the low wood density, high-mortality northwestern (NW) Amazon (in northern Peru).2. Among those genera that are shared between regions there were no detectable regional differences in mortality rates. This suggests that floristic compositional differences are a major driver of the twofold regional contrast in stand-level mortality.3. In NE forests, mortality risk of individual trees is best predicted by low taxon-level wood density, slow relative growth, and large size, reflecting phylogenetically determined life-history strategy, physiological stress and senescence.4. In NW forests, trees with low wood density and slow relative growth are also at most risk, but probability of death is independent of tree size, indicating that senescence is unimportant in this region.5. Synthesis. This study shows that despite fundamental floristic and dynamic differences between the two Amazonian regions, mortality risk can be predicted with mixed-species, individual-based statistical models and that the predictors are remarkably similar, such that tree growth and wood density both play important roles.;;;;;;;;;45;2;42;0;48;0022-0477;;WOS:000252899300005;

Tree height, stem diameter and cross-sectional area, and total biomass were enhanced under elevated CO2 concentration, and reduced under high planting density. Most traits of stem bark were improved under elevated CO2 concentration and reduced under high planting density. Stem wood production was significantly increased in volume under elevated CO2 concentration under both densities, and the stem wood density decreased under elevated CO2 concentration and increased under high planting density. These results suggest that the response of stem wood and bark to elevated CO2 concentration is density dependent. This may be of great importance in a future CO2 enriched world in natural forests where plant density varies considerably. The results also show that the bark/wood ratio in diameter, stem cross-sectional area and dry weight are not proportionally affected by elevated CO2 concentration under the two contrasting planting densities. This indicates that the response magnitude of stem bark and stem wood to elevated CO2 concentration are different but their response directions are the same.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;0;1;1672-9072;;WOS:000253711300002;18713358

Don, including seedling and clonal trials. Estimated genetic parameters evidently varied according to populations, environments, and ages. Overall, estimated heritability for wood-quality traits (except shrinkage) was always higher than for growth and form traits. Wood density had the highest grand-mean of estimated heritability (0.63) among the six wood-quality traits. followed by microfibril angle (0.61). spiral grain (0.55). fibre (tracheid) length (0.54), stiffness (0.50), and shrinkage (0.20). Selective breeding for these wood-quality traits (except shrinkage) Would be very effective. Among the five growth and form traits, branch cluster frequency had the highest heritability (0.35), followed by branch size (0.27). branch angle (0.25), diameter at breast height (0.23). and stern straightness (0.23). Broad-sense heritability estimates were higher than narrow-sense heritability, particularly for diameter at breast height (average 0.39 versus 0.21). This indicates there is considerable non-additive genetic variance that should be exploited in breeding and deployment programmes for P. radiata. There was a higher and more complex genotype by environment interaction (G x E) for diameter at breast height in Australian sites than in New Zealand sites. Growth rate (dbh) was adversely correlated with all wood-quality traits (for both density and mean stiffness rg = -0.48). Breeding for overcoming or at least coping with adverse genetic correlations and effective utilisation of non-additive genetic variation are two of the most challenging issues in the advanced generations of P radiata tree improvement and deployment programmes.;;;;;;;;;21;0;19;1;24;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI200800528973;

Moreover, the variation in wood density within annual rings was studied at the different heights and radial positions in the stem. The material consisted of 85 trees from central and south-eastern Finland. Variation between the annual rings accounted for 11-27% of the total variation in wood density. Only small differences (3-6%) in wood density were found between different heights in the stem. The largest (49-80%) variation in wood density was found within the annual rings. The difference in wood density between earlywood and latewood was smaller in the rings near the pith than in the outer rings. The increasing wood density from the pith outwards was related to increasing latewood density and latewood percentage, whereas the earlywood density increased only slightly from the pith outwards. In a given cambial age (i.e., given rings from the pith), the average wood density of annual rings increased with increasing stem height. In contrast, in the rings formed in the same calendar years (i.e., given rings from the bark), the average wood density of annual rings decreased with increasing stem height.

Local trees exhibited higher growth rate at two sites and better stem form, but also deeper Pilodyn penetration, at all sites; thus, there is potential to infuse new genetic variation into the current breeding population in the region. A significant amount of genetic variation was found for all traits assessed, with growth traits [diameter (DBH), height (HT) and volume (VOL)] showing different genetic structure and degree of genetic control as compared to stem straightness (FORM), bark thickness (BARK) and Pilodyn penetration (PILO). The effect of origin was negligible for growth traits while it was important for the other traits, so it should be considered in the Selection strategy; in addition, individual heritability for growth traits (0.11-0.16 in the combined analyses) was generally lower than for the other traits (0.20-0.35). Genetic correlations between sites for all traits were high enough to indicate that genotype-environment interaction would not affect the selection program by using a single breeding population for this region.

The rare Sand Forest, has been identified as an endemic, diverse vegetation type that is under threat from land transformation and human utilisation outside conservation areas. The growth rate of the selected woody species was evaluated over a 71-month survey that encompassed climatic extremes, oscillating from heavy rainfall to drought in a short period of time. The mean annual stem circumference growth rate among the investigated species varied thirteen fold, from a low of 2.04 mm/yr for Brachylaena huillensis to 26.28 mm/yr for Garcinia livingstonei. When the data of all species were considered, there was a significant positive relationship between stem circumference and growth rate, but no significant relationship between wood density and growth rate. The present results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of mean annual growth rate between the Sand Forest and woodland vegetation types. In general, woodland species showed larger fluctuations in growth rate and the temporal pattern of Sand Forest species seemed to lag behind that of the woodland species. These trends can in part be ascribed to the woodland species all being deciduous, whereas the Sand Forest suite included both deciduous and evergreen species. Annual growth rates measured from dry season to dry season were not related to the seasonal rainfall pattern, but appeared to be highly dependent on the water availability at the time of the enumeration. The larger size classes reacted sooner to decreased water availability and a reduction in growth of larger trees was accompanied by an increase in growth in the smaller size classes. (C) 2007 SAAB.

A total of 14 trees from three different clones, all P. trichocarpa x deltoides (T x D) hybrids, were felled in a poplar plantation in Lille (Belgium): six 'Beaupre', four 'Hazendans' and four 'Hoogvorst'. Growth rate was found to have no significant influence on the physical mechanical properties. Although the investigated clones are genetically closely related, important variations in physical and mechanical properties were observed. Specific features such as spatial distribution of tension wood and dimensional stability are the main quality factors. It was concluded that 'Beaupre' is suitable for a wide range of high value added applications, such as plywood or construction wood. 'Hazendans' and 'Hoogvorst' will need adapted technology in processing. Further research is needed to characterize clonally induced variation in properties and to assess adequate processing strategies for multiclonal poplar stands.;;;;;;;;;18;0;5;0;18;1286-4560;;WOS:000249280200005;

The data are based on a total of 204 different genotypes of progeny of 'Gwen' avocado. Each was replicated four times, with two replicates planted in each of two locations in southern California (Irvine and Riverside). Data were collected over 4 years (consecutive) on tree height, canopy diameter, and trunk diameter, representing three distinct measures of growth rate. Growth data were found to fit a linear regression over years, so the slope (growth rate) was used in the analyses. In addition, 2 years of data on flower abundance and 1 year on fruit set were also collected. Quantitative genetic analyses of these data showed that broad-sense heritability (H) was 35.5%, 30.3%, and 26.6% for tree height, canopy diameter, and trunk diameter respectively; and 33.8% and 23.0% for flowering abundance and fruit set respectively. No genotype-by-location effect was noted for growth rate; however, flower abundance and fruit set showed a relatively weak genotype-by-location effect (21.9% and 17.1% respectively). The H estimates are low, probably as a result of sources of uncontrolled environmental error associated with variation in initial planting dates, but fall within the range that should permit quantitative trait locus analyses. The authors also found a moderate positive correlation between tree growth rates and fruit set, but none between growth rates and flower abundance. Different pollen parents have significantly different impacts on tree growth rates, flower abundance, and fruit set.";;;;;;;;;9;0;9;0;9;0003-1062;;WOS:000249178800015;

Karst.) tree. From the shape of each stress-strain curve, which was calculated from bending tests that accounted for shear deformation, we determined the modulus of elasticity (MOE), the modulus of rupture (MOR), the completeness of the material, an idealized stress-strain curve and the work involved in bending. In general, all mechanical properties increased with distance from the pith, with values in the ranges of 5.7-18 GPa for MOE, 23-90 MPa for MOR and 370-630 and 430-1100 kg m(-3) for dry and fresh wood densities, respectively. The first three properties generally decreased with stem height, whereas fresh wood density increased. Multiple regression equations were calculated, relating MOR, MOE and dry wood density to growth properties. We applied these equations to the growth of the entire stem and considered the annual rings as superimposed cylindrical shells, resulting in stem-section values of MOE, MOR and dry and fresh densities as a function of stem height and cambial age. The standing tree exhibits an inner stem structure that is well designed for bending, especially at a mature stage.;;;;;;;;;14;0;11;0;14;0829-318X;;WOS:000249679000002;17545123

The study was conducted in 16 closed chambers, providing a factorial combination of two temperature regimes and two CO2 concentrations (ambient and elevated), with four trees in each treatment. The climate scenario included a doubling of [CO2] and a corresponding increase of 2-6 degrees C in temperature at the site depending on the season. Anatomical characteristics analyzed were annual earlywood, latewood and ring widths, intra-ring wood densities (earlywood, latewood and mean wood density), tracheid width, length, wall thickness, lumen diameter, wall thickness:lumen diameter ratio and mass per unit length (coarseness), and numbers of rays, resin canals and tracheids per xylem cross-sectional area. Elevated [CO2] increased ring width in four of six treatment years; earlywood width increased in the first two years and latewood width in the third year. Tracheid walls in both the earlywood and latewood tended to become thicker over the 6-year treatment period when temperature or [CO2] was elevated alone, whereas in the combined treatment they tended to become thinner relative to the tracheids of trees grown under ambient conditions. Latewood tracheid lumen diameters were larger in all the treatments relative to ambient conditions over the 6-year period, whereas lumen diameters in earlywood increased only in response to elevated [CO2] and were 3-6% smaller in the treatments with elevated temperature than in ambient conditions. Tracheid width, length and coarseness were greater in trees grown in elevated than in ambient temperature. The number of resin canals per mm(2) decreased in the elevated [CO2] treatment and increased in the elevated temperature treatments relative to ambient conditions. The treatments decreased the number of rays and tracheids per mm(2) of cross-sectional area, the greatest decrease occurring in the elevated [CO2] treatment.

Karst.) clones differing in growth characteristics were tested for maximum specific hydraulic conductivity (k(s100))l vulnerability to cavitation and behavior under mechanical stress. The vulnerability of the clones to cavitation was assessed by measuring the applied air pressure required to cause 12 and 50% loss of conductivity (Psi(12), Psi(50)) and the percent loss of conductivity at 4 MPa applied air pressure (PLC4MPa). The bending strength and stiffness and the axial compression strength and stiffness of the same stem segments were measured to characterize wood mechanical properties. Growth ring width, wood density, latewood percentage, lumen diameter, cell wall thickness, tracheid length and pit dimensions of earlywood cells, spiral grain and microfibril angles were examined to identify structure-function relationships. High k(s100) was strongly and positively related to spiral grain angle. which corresponded positively to tracheid length and pit dimensions. Spiral grain may reduce flow resistance of the bordered pits of the first earlywood tracheids, which are characterized by rounded tips and an equal distribution of pits along the entire length. Wood density was unrelated to hydraulic vulnerability parameters. Traits associated with higher hydraulic vulnerability were long tracheids, high latewood percentage and thick earlywood cell walls. The positive relationship between earlywood cell wall thickness and vulnerability to cavitation suggest that air seeding through the margo of bordered pits may occur in earlywood. There was a positive phenotypic and genotypic relationship between k(s100) and PLC4MPa, and both parameters were positively related to tree growth rate. Variability in mechanical properties depended mostly on wood density, but also on the amount of compression wood. Accordingly, hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength or stiffness showed no tradeoff.;;;;;;;;;30;1;23;0;31;0829-318X;;WOS:000248740800009;17472942

The average ring width successfully correlated wood density and tracheid anatomical properties of red pines (Pinus resinosa Ait.) from a never-thinned experimental plantation forest with five different initial plantation densities. The results indicate that plantation density has a pronounced effect on earlywood growth, which resulted in increased latewood volumetric fraction and uniform tracheid radial and wall thickness distribution.

Tree samples were obtained from heavily and moderately thinned and unthinned 33-35 year-old plantations. Wood properties were examined in various wood zones including 16 annual rings after the first treatment. The results of this study showed that there was a significant relationship between thinning intensity and radial increment (1.30 m) for an individual tree. Thinning treatments increased annual ring width especially a few years after thinning. Heavy thinning treatments were especially effective in impacting mean ring width values at breast height. However, the percentage of late wood did not differ much between the samples. Based on the results of correlation analysis between ring width and late wood percentage there was no significant correlation identified. Mean wood density was not affected by the treatments. Also, no significant correlation was found between thinning and examined strength properties (MOR, MOE and compression strength parallel to grain). However, a relationship was found between wood density and all strength properties except for MOE. The current results suggest that thinning can produce improvements in ring width without any negative impacts on investigated wood properties. It is recommended that subsequent studies should be designed to understand genetic effects and maximize treatment effects.;;;;;;;;;14;0;9;0;14;1286-4560;;WOS:000246725200012;

We examined changes in tree growth rates over the past two decades for all species occurring in large (50-ha) forest dynamics plots in Panama and Malaysia. Stem growth rates declined significantly at both forests regardless of initial size or organizational level (species, community or stand). Decreasing growth rates were widespread, occurring in 24-71% of species at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI) and in 58-95% of species at Pasoh, Malaysia (depending on the sizes of stems included). Changes in growth were not consistently associated with initial growth rate, adult stature, or wood density. Changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes: at both sites growth was negatively correlated with annual mean daily minimum temperatures, and at BCI growth was positively correlated with annual precipitation and number of rainfree days (a measure of relative insolation). While the underlying cause(s) of decelerating growth is still unresolved, these patterns strongly contradict the hypothesized pantropical increase in tree growth rates caused by carbon fertilization. Decelerating tree growth will have important economic and environmental implications.;;;;;;;;;87;1;85;1;94;1461-023X;;WOS:000246364500003;17498145

We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.";;;;;;;;;21;0;18;1;21;1354-1013;;WOS:000245987300005;

Karst.). The models had to be applicable as a part of a stand growth simulation system that is based on growth models for individual trees. Data were collected from long-term thinning and fertilisation experiments in Finland and Sweden. The wood and tracheid properties were mainly related to the radial increment rate and ring number counted from the pith outwards. Site index was also a statistically significant variable in most of the models. Increasing the increment rate, caused by thinning or fertilisation, resulted in similar kinds of changes in the wood and tracheid properties, irrespective of the factor promoting radial increment. Even though most of the average values of the wood and tracheid properties were predicted unbiased, there was large random variation between individual trees and annual rings. The variation that accounted for the fixed part of the models was: tracheid length 82.8%, tracheid width 64.9%, cell wall percentage 48.0%, latewood proportion 24.8%, and wood density 21.2%. Thus, the best prediction was for tracheid length. This relationship between radial growth and wood properties will enable the application in growth models aimed at predicting the effects of stand management and environmental factors.

Our analysis focuses on vegetation change following abandonment of agricultural fields or pastures, as this is the most extensive form of major disturbance in Neotropical forests. We consider five tree community attributes: stem density, basal area, species density, species richness and species composition. We describe two case studies, in northeastern Costa Rica and Chiapas, Mexico, where both chronosequence and annual tree dynamics studies are being applied. These case studies show that the rates of change in tree communities often deviate from chronosequence trends. With respect to tree species composition, sites of different ages differ more than a single site followed over time through the same age range. Dynamic changes in basal area within stands, on the other hand, generally followed chronosequence trends. Basal area accumulation was more linked with tree growth rates than with net changes in tree density due to recruitment and mortality. Stem turnover rates were poor predictors of species turnover rates, particularly at longer time-intervals. Effects of the surrounding landscape on tree community dynamics within individual plots are poorly understood, but are likely to be important determinants of species accumulation rates and relative abundance patterns.;;;;;;;;;117;4;109;8;126;0962-8436;;WOS:000243976000011;17255036

A field randomized block experiment was established with three different scarification techniques (disc trenching, moulding and ploughing) followed by establishment of lupins by either seeds or roots. There were three blocks without and two blocks with lupins. Overall, on average for the three soil scarification techniques, the lupin treatment significantly increased the volume per hectare by 102%. The lupin treatment significantly increased the stem volume per hectare by 236% for mounding and 139% for disc trenching, whereas the 55% increase for ploughing was not significant. The increase in the total stem biomass yield per tree was more pronounced for larger trees; 46% for average trees and 106% for dominant trees. However, there were no significant differences between scarification techniques for the lupin treatment in total stem biomass yield. Over the 18-year period, the increased growth rate following the lupin treatment resulted in a significantly decreased average stem basic wood density (on average 6%) for the sample trees. Because lupin is a nitrogen-fixing plant species, the large increase in tree growth following the lupin treatment was probably an effect of increased amount of nitrogen in the soil. The results indicate that use of lupin is a possible alternative to increase site productivity of lodgepole pine on poor boreal sites.";;;;;;;;;4;0;2;0;4;0037-5330;;WOS:000251976100004;

Stands were surveyed during the summer of 2002 with standard regeneration survey plots. Results show that aspen stem density and height were lower in MSP-treated areas relative to untreated areas. Diameter growth rates were unaffected by treatment, however the percentage of stem discolouration was higher in untreated control stands compared to site prepared areas. The results of this study indicate that there are no long-term benefits to carry out MSP for aspen promotion.

The trees selected to study wood density, branching characteristics and sawn-board quality of the species, were previously selected for further breeding for their superior volume growth and stem form. Differences in mean internodal length and mean branch diameter were statistically highly significant among provenances, on average being longer and generally thicker than those of the P. elliottii and P. patula. The bark-layer of P. maximinoi was thicker than that of P. patula but it differed little in thickness with that of P. elliottii. Provenance means in air-dry wood density varied within a relatively narrow band of 0.457 to 0.483 g/cm(3), with an average mature wood density resembling closely that of P. patula. However, P. maximimoi was characterised by increased uniformity in density across its radius, as it tended to form denser wood in the central parts of its stem, causing its pith-to-bark density gradient to be flatter. Growth rate had no effect on wood density, but improved radial density uniformity was clearly associated with increased growth rate. Sawn boards were of good quality and showed little warp after drying despite the fact that some of the trees were slightly crooked, with possibly a higher incidence of compression wood. Compared to P. patula and P. elliottii this species exhibited a darker brown colour with almost a reddish tinge when freshly cut. The annual rings were hardly recognisable on rough-sawn surfaces. Wandering pith often occurred in some boards as a result of the higher degree of stem crookedness. Since the branches of P. maximinoi tend to be arranged in whorls, it can be expected that the impact of knots on the strength of the sawn boards would predominantly be the result of the combined effect of knots grouped together, rather than individual knots. This is also a valuable attribute, as the species lends itself to the production of relatively long knot-free board sections from the unpruned parts of the stem, which would enable manufacturers of finger-jointed products to increase the volumes and diversity of their products, especially where appearance is important. Loose knots occurred more frequently in boards cut from P. maximinoi compared to the two controls, most likely as a result of pruning that was carried out too late considering the fast growth of the species.;;;;;;;;;2;0;1;0;2;1029-5925;;BCI:BCI200700231020;

This increase in growth is being maintained at midrotation, with the year 13-14 volume increment being 40% greater in the standard treatment than the control, and 46% greater in the high treatment than the control. The response in growth has occurred across all stockings in the trial, although there has been a tendency for the difference in growth between the standard and high rates to be greater at higher stockings. A small but significant reduction of basic wood density and standing-tree sonic velocity in P. radiata was found in the biosolids treatments. Although the reductions in wood density and stiffness may slightly decrease the average log value in biosolids treated trees, this will be greatly outweighed by the large increase in wood volume.;;;;;;;;;12;0;10;0;12;0045-5067;;WOS:000240546500004;

Intraring wood density data were obtained using X-ray densitometry. The coefficient of additive genetic variance was stable over all ages, whereas the coefficient of environmental variances gradually decreased with increasing age, resulting in increases in heritability estimates with age for overall density. The latewood proportion had the highest heritability estimates at all ages, ranging from 0.44 to 0.66. Overall density and its various components at 28 years of age showed strong genetic correlations with their respective traits at all younger ages. Optimum selection ages for the wood density traits ranged from 8 to 14 years, at which point maximum gain efficiencies per year were obtained. There were negative correlations between wood density and radial growth rate at early ages, although these relationships tended to be weaker with increasing age. These results suggest that selection at a young age is effective for wood density, but particular care must be taken in selecting trees with an improved radial growth rate because rapid growth will result in a low-density wood product, especially in the early growth period.;;;;;;;;;10;2;7;1;13;1341-6979;;WOS:000238305100003;

We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8-25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests.Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density (rho) were used to estimate the stem biomass (M-s) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m(2) in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height.The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (M-s proportional to rho(0.77), r(2) = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness.Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/M-s), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/rho). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/M-s was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r(2) = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r(2) = 0.89).Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species >= 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/M-s, 1/rho and gap fraction.These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.;;;;;;;;;93;1;88;0;96;0022-0477;;WOS:000236717700015;

Both trees showed clear gradients in wood properties from the base to the crown. Cambial cells at the base of the tree were dividing 3.3-fold slower than those at the crown, while the average thickness of cell walls in wood was highest at the base. Cell wall thickness showed an overall correlation coefficient of > 0.7 with wood density in both genotypes. Microscopic examination of developing tracheids showed that 33% of cells had formed secondary cell walls at the base of the tree, reducing to 3% at the crown. In total, 455 genes differentially expressed in developing xylem tissue from either the base or the crown were identified using modified differential display. RT-PCR analysis of 156 genes confirmed differential expression for 77%. Of the genes tested, 73% showed gradients in transcript abundance either up or down the bole of the tree, although the steepness of the gradients differed between genes. Genes involved in cell division and expansion tended to be more highly expressed in the crown of the tree, and two putative cell-cycle repressor genes were expressed 2-fold higher at the base. Conversely, transcripts of genes involved in secondary wall thickening were more abundant at the base of the tree. These results suggest that differences in the rate of cambial cell division, differences in the rate and duration of tracheid wall thickening, and differences in gene expression underpin the gradients of wood properties found in pines.;;;;;;;;;24;2;24;0;28;0167-4412;;WOS:000235903600008;16525892

This species is considered as the fourth, most important Spanish conifer, being its timber frequently used in construction. The natural area of distribution of Laricio pine in Spain is officially divided into ten different regions of provenance, being only four of them considered as productive. The present study on the influence of growth conditions on extracted wood basic density (EBD) is carried out on 89 P. nigra trees, sampled from the two most productive Spanish regions of provenance (R.7 and R.8) in seven different sites. Cross-sectional disks were cut at 3 m (in 89 trees) and every 3 m height (in 18 trees) from the butt up to 15 m. For assessing the pattern of radial variation of the properties, 20x20x20 mm(3) wood samples were taken radially from every cross-sectional disk. In every 20x20x20 mm(3) wood sample, age and distance to the pith of the central annual ring was recorded, together with the average growth rate. Extractive content and EBD were measured in every sample. The results lead to the conclusion that there is not a significant relationship between EBD and provenance or growth rate. On the contrary, a significant relationship has been found between EBD and site quality or cambial age. The results also demonstrate that in a tree EBD tends to diminish from the base to the top and from the pith outwards. The main result of the present study is related with the observation that for the same cambial age, annual ring width has no significant influence on EBD, confirming that its utility as a predictor of the quality of timber is highly questionable, at least if the ring curvature is not considered.;;;;;;;;;7;1;6;0;8;0043-7719;;WOS:000235905200002;

Although a higher growth rate would imply a higher sprouting vigour, fast-growing species may have less below-ground reserves, and thus, a lower sprouting potential. The relative importance of both opposite effects was little explored in the literature. To analyse the influence of growth rate on sprouting vigour, one growth season after a fire we measured plant height of the old (pre-fire) and new (post-fire) tissue in 194 individuals of 14 woody species from a woodland in central Argentina. We calculated a mean value of pre- and post-fire height for each species, and obtained from a database potential height at maturity, wood density (WD) and specific leaf area (SLA), as surrogates of intrinsic growth rate. We performed a forward stepwise multiple regression using WD and SLA, together with mean pre-fire height or potential height as independent variables, and mean post-fire height (as an indicator of resprout vigour) as the dependent variable. Interactions were also tested. Pre-fire height, WD and their interaction term were the variables that best explained post-fire height. We also analysed the relationship between pre- and post-fire size for each species independently by fitting hyperbolic functions. Then we correlated both parameters of the functions to species characteristics (WD, SLA, potential height and mean pre-fire height). Both parameters of the hyperbolic functions were significantly correlated only with WD, but not with the other species characteristics. All results together indicate that species with low WD (i.e. high potential growth rate) regrow more vigorously than species with high WD when pre-fire individuals were tall. In contrast, when pre-fire individuals were small, WD had no influence on sprout vigour. A trade-off between allocation of biomass to underground reserves and shoot growth seems to be responsible for the patterns obtained. For small individuals, below-ground reserves seem to play a more important role than inherent growth rate (here measured through WD) in determining the sprouting vigour, while for large individuals, growth rate seems more important than reserves.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;6;1442-9985;;WOS:000233411000006;

Along these gradients, four relatively discrete tree guilds could be distinguished: fast-growing pioneer species, shade-tolerant subcanopy species, canopy trees, and emergent species. Pioneers were uncommon and most trees were canopy or emergent species, which frequently had low mortality and recruitment. Wood density was negatively associated with tree mortality, recruitment, and growth rates when all species were considered. Growth rates varied markedly among and within species, with pioneers exhibiting far faster and less variable growth rates than did the other species. Slow growth in subcanopy species relative to canopy and emergent trees was not a simple consequence of mean tree size, but apparently resulted from physiological constraints imposed by low-light and other conditions in the forest understorey.Conclusions: Trees of Amazonian rain forests could be classified with some success into four relatively distinctive guilds. However, several demographic and life-history traits, such as those that distinguish early and late successional species, probably vary along a continuum, rather than being naturally grouped into relatively discrete categories.;;;;;;;;;30;0;25;1;31;1100-9233;;WOS:000234454500003;

Karst) was studied in two long-term thinning experiments (Heinola and Punkaharju) in southeastern Finland. The stand age was 86 and 67 years in Heinola and Punkaharju, respectively. Thinning intensities in this study were lower and higher than recommended in the 1960s for forestry practice in Finland. An increase in tree growth rate (31% in Heinola and 37% in Punkaharju) caused by the high thinning intensity resulted in slightly shorter tracheids (9% in Heinola and 4% in Punkaharju) than with the low thinning intensity. Increased growth rate had no pronounced effect on tracheid cell wall thickness and lumen diameter. A faster growth rate slightly decreased the average cell wall thickness of an annual ring, but the changes in average lumen diameter were small. The effect of thinning intensity was similar in earlywood and latewood. Variation in fiber properties between and within individual trees and annual rings was large. In conclusion, the current thinning intensities used in Finnish forestry practice enhance growth rate but have a rather small effect on tracheid dimensions.;;;;;;;;;27;1;20;2;29;0045-5067;;WOS:000234653000015;

Keet plantation near Tzaneen. Ten trees from each of four markedly different planting densities were chosen to provide contrasting material to study the effects of growth rate on the quality of the wood produced. Spacing treatment diameter means ranged from 18.9 to 57.9 cm.An inverse relationship was found between planting density and wood density. Typical pith-to-bark density profiles for trees at this age occurred in the trees with rapid growth, i.e. steep gradients from the pith towards the bark during the early stages of growth, followed by a gradual transition into more constant mature wood density values. Trees of which the growth had been curbed by higher planting densities, on the other hand, showed little sign of levelling off. As a result, the faster growing trees contained significantly larger proportions of relatively homogeneous wood compared to the slower grown trees, giving them an obvious quality advantage over slower grown trees. Accelerated growth thus seems to yield trees that can be utilized more effectively and converted into products with more reliable performance characteristics.Fast growth seemed to promote interlocking grain, but the correlation with interlocking grain severity was too poor to be of any practical significance. Mean splitting showed a downward trend with decreasing planting density, but statistically the differences were non-significant. A statistically significant correlation was found between the amount of splitting in logs and the proportional length of sawn boards affected by splits immediately after wet-mill processing. At the end of the sawmilling process, however, such correlation did not exist any longer, suggesting that the boards responded differently to drying stresses and impacts during handling and transport with regard to further splitting. No significant effect of planting density on sawn volume losses due to splitting or collapse could be detected.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1029-5925;;BCI:BCI200600364187;

Don trees were grown in the presence and absence of the woody weed broom (Cytisus scoparius L.) on a dryland site for 2 years to determine the effects of competition from weeds on wood properties in juvenile trees. Wood property measurements made on cross-sections from the bark to the pith were scaled to convert results from distance to a time basis using sigmoidal equations fitted to monthly measurements of tree diameter. When averaged across the 2 years, the presence of the weeds significantly increased wood density (+11%), wall thickness (+6%) and modulus of elasticity (MOE(SS), +93%), and significantly reduced microfibril angle (MFA, -21%) and radial diameter (-8%). Radial growth rate was significantly correlated to wood density, and this relationship held across both treatment and age. At the seasonal scale, there was close correspondence between changes in MFA and growth rate. Ring width was significantly related to both MFA and MOE(SS) at the annual scale. Although both of these relationships held across treatments, year significantly influenced the value of coefficients in the relationships. The results highlight the direct effects of the presence of weeds on wood properties and the need to consider silvicultural treatments appropriate for balancing gains in productivity with losses in wood quality for timber production.;;;;;;;;;16;1;17;0;19;0931-1890;;WOS:000231645000011;

Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1 - 1.5m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis ( PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size.Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size.Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.;;;;;;;;;12;0;12;0;12;0305-7364;;WOS:000230724400015;15944175

The development of simple predictors of tree growth is important in understanding forest dynamics. For this purpose, tree height, crown width in two perpendicular directions, trunk diameter at 1.3 m height (d.b.h.) and crown illumination index (CI) were determined for 727 pole-sized trees (8-20 cm d.b.h.) of 21 species, on forest dynamics plots at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia and Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. A light-interception index (LI = A(cr)CI(2), where A(cr) is crown area) was calculated for each tree, and wood density (stem wood dry mass/fresh volume) was estimated for each species from reported values.2. Diameter growth rates were linearly correlated with LI (mean per species r(2) = 0.45, excluding substantially damaged and vine-covered trees).3. Among trees of all species, diameter growth rate was highly correlated with LI/wood density.4. Mean growth rate per species varied 10-fold among the study species, but increased linearly with mean LI/wood density ratio (r(2) = 0.78), consistent with the previous pattern.5. Thus much of the variability in tree growth rates, both within and among species, can be accounted for by the simple mechanistic assumption that, within a given size class, growth is proportional to light interception/wood density.;;;;;;;;;87;6;85;2;97;0269-8463;;WOS:000230601500011;

Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance.2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass.3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient.4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient.5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation.

Karst.) were monitored over 4 years, at four heights up the stem, by means of point-dendrometers. The trees were then felled and radial wood samples were cut from the radii that had been monitored by the dendrometers and analyzed for density. From the radial growth measurements recorded by the dendrometers, we related positions within the rings to dates, thus making possible investigation of the relationships between changes within the rings in wood density and fluctuations in climate or growth rate. Radial growth started in early April and ended, with large intra-annual differences, in August or September. Short-term variations in growth rate were related to fluctuations in climate parameters and soil water reserves. The sensitivity of radial growth to climate decreased with stem height. Wood density responded strongly to drought events, and a dry period in June 1996 induced false-ring formation. Wood density was relatively independent of growth rate and climatic conditions during the first part of the growing season, but increased with decreasing radial growth rate later in the growing season.;;;;;;;;;69;9;59;1;79;0829-318X;;WOS:000230024000002;15805085

Such changes may alter the sustainability of these uneven-aged ecosystems. The hypothesis that the decline observed in sugar maple populations over recent decades has modified stand structure and composition was tested using data from the Forest Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Network (RESEF) in Quebec, Canada. Analysis of the diameter class density distribution, growth rates, and mortality schedule for 12 stands indicated a decline in health and productivity in the sugar maple population. This result suggests that environmental factors have limited the development of this species in all strata. The American beech population responded by doubling its pole cohort density in 10 years. Although increases in American beech stem density tended to counter sugar maple mortality, results suggest that stand structure has been shifted from a sustainable structure to an unsustainable one over a 10-year period. The high mortality of sugar maple and the large increase of pole-size beech trees deeply altered forest structure and composition in the majority of stands studied. These changes question seriously the sustainability of sugar maple in these forest ecosystems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;;;;;;;;;33;3;30;0;37;0378-1127;;WOS:000227860700016;

We analyse how T. vasquezii is able to maintain itself successfully by comparing its life-history traits with those of polycarpic tree species of the same community. We then evaluate the relative importance of such traits using population matrix models.2 Monocarpic species are expected to have a high fecundity. Seed production per basal area for T. vasquezii is indeed nearly twice that of an average polycarpic species, but this is not sufficient to maintain stable populations.3 Life-history theory predicts that a monocarpic strategy is advantageous if juvenile survival rates are high compared with adult survival. Although seedlings of T. vasquezii have a lower mortality rate than polycarpic species, its sapling have higher mortality.4 We found that the success of T. vasquezii is due to its very high diameter growth rates in the larger size classes, which are four times higher than that of an average, co-occurring polycarpic species. Fast diameter growth is enabled by investment in large, leafy crowns and by a low wood density. Applying this high diameter growth in a population model yielded a population growth rate close to that of polycarpic species. Life table response experiment analysis of Tachigali and polycarp models showed that higher growth compensated for the negative demographic effect of 100% adult mortality following reproduction.5 Rapid growth enables T. vasquezii to reach reproductive maturity in only 49 years, compared with 79 years for an average polycarpic species. It also reduces the risk of dying before reproducing, and 50% more seedlings survive to maturity for T. vasquezii compared with polycarpic species.6 The dramatic negative demographic consequences of one-time flowering can therefore be completely balanced by taking a shorter time to reach maturity. Taking a time perspective, it appears that Tachigali vasquezii has an advanced, rather than a delayed, reproduction.;;;;;;;;;12;0;12;0;14;0022-0477;;WOS:000227721400004;

We examined the relative importance of tree size, species, biogeographic origin, local topography, and damage from previous storms in long-term permanent plots in a rehabilitated subtropical moist forest in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Georges in order to better predict patterns of resistance. Severe damage included uprooted trees, snapped stems, or crowns with greater than 50 percent branch loss. Hurricane induced mortality after 21 mo was 5.2 percent/yr, more than seven times higher than background mortality levels during the nonhurricane periods. Species differed greatly in their mortality and damage patterns, but there was no relationship between damage and wood density or biogeographic origin. Rather, damage for a given species was correlated with mean annual increment, with faster growing species experiencing greater damage, suggesting that growth rate may reflect a variety of life history tradeoffs. Size was also predictive of damage, with larger trees suffering more damage. Trees on ridges and in valleys received greater damage than trees on slopes. A strong relationship was noted between previous hurricane damage and present structural damage, which could not solely be explained by the patterns with size and species. We suggest that resistance of trees to hurricane damage is therefore not only correlated with individual and species characteristics but also with past disturbance history, which suggests that in interpreting the effects of hurricanes on forest structure, individual storms cannot be treated as discrete, independent events.;;;;;;;;;51;1;50;1;52;juin-06;;WOS:000227417200003;

In trees, aspects of both physiological tolerance ( e. g. drought tolerance) and life history ( e. g. life span and growth rate) are related to stem traits such as wood density and height relative to diameter. We examined how the evolution of stem traits is related to geographic range sizes in Eucalyptus at two spatial scales: across the Australian continent and within the wet forests near the east coast of Australia. Geographic range sizes were estimated from herbarium records. Stem trait data were collected from both natural populations and published sources. We used phylogenetically independent contrasts to test for evolutionary associations between stem traits and geographic range sizes. Across Australia, the evolution of stem traits conferring drought tolerance were not consistently associated greater range sizes. This was surprising since arid and semi- arid environments are geographically expansive. Within the eastern forests, the evolution of stem traits de. ning slow growing, competitively dominant life histories were associated with greater range sizes. These stem traits should confer both a capacity to disperse into previously unoccupied habitats and the ability to persist in habitats already occupied. Traits associated with physiological tolerance and life history had significant effects on the evolution of range sizes in Eucalyptus. However, we demonstrate that the impact of these traits on range size evolution depends on both environmental conditions and the scale at which these traits are examined.;;;;;;;;;4;0;4;0;4;0067-1924;;WOS:000232225600002;

Management practices evolved rapidly during the twentieth century, and are regarded as advanced in terms of the application of sound scientific and economic principles. However, since the 1970s, forest managers in New Zealand have become more aware of the impacts of genetic selection for growth and stem form, and the adoption of more aggressive silvicultural techniques, on the nature of the resource. These trends have resulted in a significant reduction in rotation lengths from more than 40 years to around 25 years. Growing space, tree age, and geographic location create very pronounced patterns of wood property development and, while growth rates can be impressive, some of the resulting wood characteristics are somewhat limiting for demanding end uses.Scientific studies over the past 20 years or so have defined the important wood characteristics (knot size and distribution, resin pockets, intra-ring checking, density, spiral grain, microfibril angle) that affect product appearance, stiffness, and stability. Two distinct approaches have been adopted to improve the plantation resource:(1) Identifying and managing variability in the forest(2) Breeding to manipulate specific characteristicsValue recovery from harvesting is in rapid change from a system based on volume to one based on quality. There is now a strong emphasis on tools for log and lumber segregation, and reliable methods are available for assessing stiffness at all stages from forest to lumber. For the immediate future, traditional forest inventory methods are being enhanced by the inclusion of wood property information such as wood density and predicted stiffness. Acoustic tools in particular have become common for standing tree and log stiffness assessment and a similar approach is being used for lumber and veneer grading; spectroscopic tools are also underdevelopment. Tree breeders are actively selecting material to improve future generations, and fortunately the heritabilities of wood properties are generally high. However, many of these features are costly to evaluate on a routine basis and the search is on for more sophisticated tools to assess performance capability directly. The next challenge is to develop similar cost-effective techniques for predicting product stability. Faster progress will be made when wood processors reward growers for quality wood.";;;;;;;;;4;0;3;0;4;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI200600476578;

The stand, naturally regenerated from fire in 1906, was located in Chibougamau. 400 km north of Quebec. Each tree. was assigned a local stand density ranging from 1390 to 3590 stems/ha, calculated from the number of neighboring trees. The trees were grouped into three stand density categories (1790, 2700, and 3400 stems/ha). Each sample tree was analyzed by X-ray densitometry. and various ring features including ring width and wood density were measured for each ring front pith to bark, at three heights (2.4, 5.1, and 7.8 m) and ring area and earlywood proportion were computed. For all features studied, the variation due to sampling height was larger than that due to stand density. The longitudinal variations for ring density and earlywood density depend largely upon the wood type (juvenile wood or mature wood). A variation of fine density with sampling height in the stern from 425 to 458 kg/m(3) was observed in juvenile wood, but variations with stand density in all the growth ring features studied were small. Notably, it was observed that stand density had more influence on ring width features than on ring density features.;;;;;;;;;25;0;9;0;25;0735-6161;;WOS:000226339700009;

Sarg.) trees growing in 15 plots representing a wide range of tree and site conditions in northwestern Oregon. Growth and wood density traits of individual rings were measured via X-ray densitometry, and relationships of ring density and its components to age and growth rate were analyzed. Ring density was highest (0.49 g/cm(3)) near the pith, declined to 0.40 g/cm(3) at age 10, remained stable to about age 25, and then increased gradually and remained between 0.43 and 0.44 g/cm(3) from age 38 to 45 and beyond. A negative influence of rapid growth on whole ring density was greatest at young ages and diminished with time, becoming nonsignificant beyond age 30. Earlywood density, latewood density, and latewood proportion were all negatively related to ring width at young ages, but by age 21-25, latewood proportion was the only component of ring density that remained significantly diminished by increased growth rate. Residual differences in wood density (after age and growth rate were considered) did not appear to be related to either stand density or site class. Overall, young-growth hemlock trees are relatively uniform in wood density and likely to be more so if grown in intensively managed stands.;;;;;;;;;12;0;6;0;14;0045-5067;;WOS:000226595800004;

The model is based on analyses of extensive field studies carried out on permanent forest inventory plots, and syntheses of published studies. New analyses included: ( 1) growth suppression of small trees, ( 2) maximum size ( trunk base diameter) for 220 tree species, ( 3) the relationship between growth rate and wood density, and ( 4) the growth response of surviving trees to catastrophic mortality ( from logging). The model simulates a forest inventory plot, and tracks recruitment, growth, and mortality of live trees, decomposition of dead trees ( coarse litter), and how these processes vary with changing environmental conditions. Model predictions were tested against aggregated field data, and also compared with independent measurements including maximum tree age and coarse litter standing stocks. Spatial analyses demonstrated that a plot size of similar to 10 ha was required to accurately measure wood ( live and dead) carbon balance. With the model accurately predicting relevant pools and fluxes, a number of model experiments were performed to predict forest carbon balance response to perturbations including: ( 1) increased productivity due to CO2 fertilization, ( 2) a single semi-catastrophic ( 10%) mortality event, ( 3) increased recruitment and mortality ( turnover) rates, and ( 4) the combined effects of increased turnover, increased tree growth rates, and decreased mean wood density of new recruits. Results demonstrated that carbon accumulation over the past few decades observed on tropical forest inventory plots (similar to 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) is not likely caused by CO2 fertilization. A maximum 25% increase in woody tissue productivity with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 only resulted in an accumulation rate of 0.05 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the period 1980 - 2020 for a Central Amazon forest, or an order of magnitude less than observed on the inventory plots. In contrast, model parameterization based on extensive data from a logging experiment demonstrated a rapid increase in tree growth following disturbance, which could be misinterpreted as carbon sequestration if changes in coarse litter stocks were not considered. Combined results demonstrated that predictions of changes in forest carbon balance during the twenty-first century are highly dependent on assumptions of tree response to various perturbations, and underscores the importance of a close coupling of model and field investigations.;;;;;;;;;47;0;37;0;48;0029-8549;;WOS:000224999800006;15365808

The possibility of using selfed families for estimation of genetic parameters and future breeding was investigated. For diameter, inbreeding depression (ID) varied between 13 and 17% at different ages across different sites. An ID of about 13% and -3.0% was obtained for straightness and wood density, respectively. For Dothistroma, the pattern of ID at different ages was not consistent across different environments. There was generally a close agreement, for all traits except diameter, between estimates of narrow-sense heritability obtained from selfed and outcrossed progenies. Estimated correlations between predicted breeding values at different ages were higher for selfed families compared to outcrossed families, indicating that early selection would be more effective among selfed families than among outcrossed families. For all traits except diameter growth, ranking of parents on selfed performance was highly correlated with outcrossed performance at the selection age. This study showed that selection on selfs (even after culling of less vigorous individuals at the nursery stage) would not be effective for diameter growth, but it might be a reasonably good strategy for form traits, Dothistroma resistance, and wood density.;;;;;;;;;6;0;4;0;6;0015-749X;;WOS:000225369100001;

Trees from three progenies were selected with a high growth rate relative to an unimproved control of directly imported material from the Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI), British Columbia, Canada. Trees from a further three progenies were selected that displayed a similar growth rate to the QCI control. At the time of sampling, the fastgrowing progenies had a mean volume gain over the QCI and slow-growing progenies of 70 per cent. Trees from the fast-growing progenies were found to have significantly larger branches, less latewood, and more compression wood in comparison with the QCI control and the slow-growing progenies. On the other hand, trees from the fast-growing progenies had a smaller grain angle than the QCI control. While fast-growing progenies had lower wood density than the control, this was not significantly different. These findings suggest that, in general, the criteria used to select Sitka spruce trees in the forest as potential candidates for the breeding population would indeed lead to significant improvements of the growth performance and grain angle from improved planting stock.

(gmelina) occurs naturally in 11 countries in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Approximately 700,000 ha of gmelina have now been established in plantations, small woodlots and agroforestry settings in west-central and eastern Africa, southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and northern Latin America. It is expected that planting areas will expand to 800,000 ha by 2020. The species has generated interest because of its fast growth and quick return on investment. Its wood can be used for a multitude of products that range from pulp to furniture parts. Gmelina also has great utility in agroforestry systems. Intensive breeding and improved clones will bring better growth, more uniform wood, better disease resistance, and products of higher quality to both local and international markets. Several factors might limit the degree of improvement and use of gmelina: ( a) the species is susceptible to insect attacks and disease which might limit plantation expansion, (b) artificial pollinations are labor intensive and sometimes difficult to complete successfully, thus delaying breeding cycles and deployment of elite populations and clones and ( c) the wood density of gmelina is approximately 410 kg/m(3) at 8 years of age, which is lower than most commercial species of eucalypts and acacias. Low density affects pulp yields and product strength. These challenges can be met by: ( a) development of clones resistant to insect and disease attacks as a cost effective means to maintain plantation stocking and productivity, ( b) development of one-stop pollination techniques to increase pollination success rates and reduce the work loads in breeding programs, and ( c) utilization of the great tree to tree variation in wood properties in gmelina to develop new races of trees that have both desirable growth rates and dense wood. Access to a broad genetic base of gmelina is central to meeting these challenges.;;;;;International Gmelina Workshop;APR 04-10, 2003;"Int Tree Conservat & Domesticat Cooperat; N Carolina State Univ; PT Sumalindo Lestari Jaya";Samarinda, INDONESIA;15;0;10;1;16;0169-4286;;WOS:000223771400002;

We also assessed the influence of several life-history features (wood density, growth form, mortality rate, recruitment rate, stem diameter, growth increment, population density) on tree longevity. Data on 3159 individual trees were collected in 24 permanent, 1 ha plots in undisturbed forest arrayed across a large (ca. 1000 km(2)) study area. For each species, three estimates of longevity were generated (by dividing the stem diameter of the largest tree by the median, upper quartile, and upper decile of observed diameter-growth rates), and the mean of these three values was used as a longevity estimate. Longevity values ranged from 48 years in the pioneer Pourouma bicolor (Cecropiaceae) to 981 years for the canopy tree Pouteria manaosensis (Sapotaceae), with an overall mean of 336 +/- 196 years. These growth-based estimates of maximum tree age were concordant with those derived from analyses of mean mortality rates. Tree longevity was positively correlated with wood density, maximum stem diameter, and population density, and negatively correlated with annual mortality, recruitment, and growth rates. On average, pioneer species had much lower longevity than did non-pioneers, whereas among old-growth trees, emergent species had greater longevity than did canopy species.

Large differences in the severity of symptoms occur over small spatial scales, which arise partly because of genetic differences in nutritional traits between trees, however, suspected variations in site factors have eluded detection. Several new trials established in a second-rotation Pinus radiata stand at Puruki forest were measured to investigate the role of soil and genetic factors associated with small-scale spatial variation in Mg deficiency symptoms observed on the pumice soils there in the first-rotation.The trials included seedling and clonally propagated progeny from open pollinated parents. Ten progeny from each of 40 open pollinated families were propagated as fascicle cuttings. In addition to clones, seedlings from a Puruki Control seedlot developed from 26 open pollinated healthy seed-parent phenotypes, and a GF30 seedlot selected for improved growth rate and stem form were included. These genotypes were planted in six plot replicates each containing a single ramet of the 400 clones, and 10 plot replicates each containing a single ramet of 80 clones (a subset of the 400). The latter 10 plots also contained 10 ramets of a single clone, and 60 seedlings (30 each from Puruki Control and GF30). The 16 plots were deployed in areas with moderate to severe Mg deficiency symptoms. Additional seedlings and clones from 20 families were planted in family row plots to test for propagation effects.Magnesium deficiency symptoms in individual trees scored at stand ages 2 and 3 years showed strong plot, clone, family, and seedlot differences. Plot means ranged from 1.6 to 3.1, clone means ranged from 1.3 to 4.1, with a 1999-2000 age-age correlation for clone means of 0.69 (n = 378), and family means ranged from 1.4 to 3.6, with a 1999-2000 age-age correlation of 0.92 (n = 40). Broad sense heritability of Mg deficiency score (and S.E.) was 0.46 (0.03) and narrow sense heritability 0.69 (0.17), based on clone scores averaged over both years. These results suggest the need to avoid seedlots based on a small number of parent trees, unless clones or families of known resistance to Mg deficiency are used.Significant plot differences in solution Ca, Cu, K, Mg, S, exchangeable Na and Al were found at the 0-0.1 m depth, and solution K, total C, N, and exchangeable K at 0.5-1.0 m depth. Mg deficiency symptoms were positively correlated with exchangeable K (r = 0.83) and solution K (r = 0.70) at 0.5-1.0 m depth, and negatively correlated with exchangeable Mg concentration (r = 0.51) at 0-0.1 m depth. Spatial variation in subsoil K primarily determined plot differences in Mg deficiency symptoms at this site. Exchangeable K concentration was positively correlated with the thickness of the lapilli layer at 0.5-1 m depth, which may explain the widespread occurrence of Mg deficiency symptoms on volcanic soil when the surface horizon is dry.

Seedlings and cuttings taken from 5-year-old Pinus radiata D.Don seedlings grown in the field were included as controls. Three seedlots of different genetic improvement levels from unimproved bulk seed (GF3) to control-pollinated seed from a seed orchard (GF21) were used to study differences in growth rate, tree form, and wood properties (density and acoustic velocity) between cuttings of five different physiological ages up to 5 years and seedlings, and any interaction between physiological age and levels of genetic improvement.Results showed no persistent long-term height growth differences, and by 4 years of age, any height differences were no longer significant. GF16 and GF21 plants had significantly larger diameters than GF3 plants at both 4 and I I years of age. Also, seedlings (PA0), and cuttings from 1-year-old seedlings (PA1), had significantly larger diameters than PA5 cuttings from field-grown trees; the cuttings of other physiological ages were intermediate at both 4 and I I years of age. Physiologically older cuttings had better butt log straightness and freedom from malformation than seedlings and PA I cuttings. There was no effect of seedlot or physiological age on wood density, up to a physiological age of 5 years. However, acoustic velocity at breast height (as an indicator of stiffness) increased significantly and consistently with increasing physiological age.Previous research has shown that cuttings with a physiological age of I to 3 years will perform as well as or better than seedlings on both farm and forestry sites, with an optimum physiological age of about 3 years, when there will be improved stem form without any early loss of growth rate. This trial on a fertile ex-farm site has confirmed these trends and also shown improvement in breast-height acoustic velocity of around 6.4% from PA3 cuttings and more than 11% from PA5 field cuttings, compared with seedlings.";;;;;;;;;5;0;5;0;6;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI200510211244;

The experiment was performed during 1998-2001 in twelve-year-old apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L., cv. Bulida), growing under field conditions in Murcia, Spain (semi-arid climate, with 1500 mm average annual evaporation and 350 mm rainfall) in a clay loam texture soil (128 mm m(-1) available soil water content and 1.45 Mg m(-3) bulk density). Trees were submitted to two drip irrigated treatments: a control treatment irrigated at 100% of seasonal ETc and a water deficit treatment (WD) irrigated at 50% of the control treatment. The diurnal courses of leaf water potentials, leaf conductance, net photosynthesis, leaf temperature, sap flow and trunk diameter fluctuations were studied throughout one growing season. The deficit treatment showed stomatal regulation as an adaptive mechanisms to drought, which allows plants to regulate water loss more effectively. Leaf temperature values were higher in WD than in the control treatment, and acted as a good stress indicator. Net photosynthesis showed a good correlation with leaf conductance values. In deficit irrigation conditions, osmotic adjustment was not observed. Both leaf water potential and gas exchange parameters were well correlated with evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Trunk diameters oscillate over a 24-h cycle, reaching a maximum value just before sunrise and a minimum sometime in the afternoon. The difference between maximum and minimum values is termed maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). This parameter increased in WD plants during the first period of the growing season, however, when the water stress was accumulated (in the last period of the growing season), MDS shown an important decrease in the water stressed plants respect to the irrigated ones. The sap flow values were lower in the deficit than in the control treatment throughout the growing season, although the greatest differences were observed in spring. Trunk diameter and sap flow showed moderately good correlations with the mean daily ETo in adult apricot trees grown under non-limiting soil water conditions.;;;;;4th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops;SEP 01-06, 2003;;Davis, CA;1;0;1;0;1;0567-7572;90-6605-366-6;WOS:000227680000072;

Three different treatments and a control were available; daily irrigation, daily liquid fertilization and solid fertilization. The nutrient optimisation was based on foliage analysis and the solid fertilization essentially comprised the same amount of nutrients but was applied annually in solid form. Measurements of density and microfibril angle (MFA) were per-formed using X-ray diffraction. Growth rate, expressed as a transformation of annual ring width, was very important at the southern site when the effect of cambial maturation had been taken into account. Effects of both fertilization and irrigation remained strong and significant for density, and irrigation was a significant factor explaining MEA. At the northern site distance from pith was the dominant factor but the effect of growth rate was also strong and the treatment effect was significant for both density and MFA. The combination of higher MEA and decrease in density for fertilized trees resulted in a lower calculated strength of the wood. An over 100% increase in ring width only corresponded to approximately a 20% decrease in wood density and the production of wood dry matter was hence increased by treatments.";;;;;;;;;30;3;26;0;34;0037-5330;;WOS:000220577100009;

The unsprayed (more heavily diseased) trees had significantly narrower sapwood, narrower growth rings, lower sapwood moisture content, and narrower tracheid cell wall thickness than did the sprayed (less heavily diseased) trees. Moreover, unsprayed trees had altered earlywood density-earlywood width relationships, higher latewood proportion, and higher overall wood density than the sprayed trees. We hypothesize: (1) that the decreased moisture content of diseased trees results from their poor carbon economy resulting in insufficient energy (photosynthate) to reverse sapwood embolisms, and (2) SNC decreases wood density relative to growth rate.

Three fungi were examined, a brown-rot fungus (Gloeophyllum trabeum), a white-rot fungus (Trametes versicolor), and a standing-tree-decay fungus (Fomitopsis pinicola). The decay resistance was inversely related to the growth rate of the fungi on heartwood blocks. A total of 270 trees of 35 families were harvested from 36-year-old provenance-progeny trials at two sites through a thinning operation. The narrow-sense heritabilities of white spruce decay resistance to brown rot and white rot were 0.21 and 0.27, respectively. There were no significant differences in resistance to standing-tree-decay fungus among the families. The phenotypic and genetic correlations between the growth rate of brown rot on heartwood blocks and wood density were positive, but the genetic correlation between wood density and the growth rate of white rot on heartwood blocks was negative but not significant. The results indicate that the different species of fungi have different relationships with the annual growth of trees and wood density, and suggest that selection for wood density in white spruce might lead to an increase in resistance to white rot, but a decrease in resistance to brown rot.;;;;;;;;;14;0;10;0;14;0045-5067;;WOS:000186558300013;

Soil scarification influenced stem volume and stem biomass yield of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) in a 17-year-old field trial in boreal Sweden. Soil scarification (disc trenching, mounding and ploughing) resulted in an average stem volume yield of 3.1 and 34.2 m(3) ha(-1) on the poor and intermediate sites, respectively, while corresponding values for no soil scarification were 0.9 and 16.7 m(3) ha(-1). In comparison to no scarification, ploughing increased volume yields by 500% on the poor site and by 200% on the intermediate sites. The ranking according to stem volume yield was ploughing > disc trenching = mounding greater than or equal to no soil scarification. Averaged over the two sites, the mean annual increment of stem biomass was 219% and 145% higher (in d.w., 0.26 kg and 0.34 kg per sample tree) after ploughing compared with no soil scarification, for the average and dominant sample trees, respectively. Although not significant, the increased growth rate after soil scarification decreased the average stem basic wood density of the sample trees with 1.6% and 5.3%, at the poor and intermediate sites, respectively. In conclusion, soil scarification significantly increased the 17-year stem volume yield compared with no scarification. The results also indicate that the difference in stem biomass yield between ploughing and the other methods, especially no soil scarification, will increase even more in the near future.;;;;;;;;;17;0;15;0;17;0169-4286;;WOS:000183709600002;

The five radiata pine tree 'genotypes' tested in this experiment displayed differences in growth and form 10 years after planting. However, there were no statistically significant interactions between tree genotype and understorey effects. The two best 'genotypes' were superior in nearly all respects (growth, branch size and stem form), on all pasture types. These results concur with other research results that indicate that the best radiata pine genotypes will perform consistently well across a range of environments in New Zealand. However, within a breeding programme, different selection criteria may be needed when selecting seedlots or clones for wide-spaced silvopastoral regimes, where trees with superior form, wood density and branch habit but only average growth rates may be preferred to more vigorous trees that rank lower for branching and form.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;1174-7986;;BCI:BCI200400471042;

Results showed that the impact of the selection on phenology was minor; differences in growth among subpopulations were mainly attributable to maximal growth rate and the duration of the period of rapid growth. The FL subpopulation showed a significantly stronger productivity decline in response to moderate drought compared to the two slower-growing subpopulations. The FH subpopulation showed significantly higher xylem specific conductivity than the two slower-growing subpopulations, and greater resistance to cavitation than the other three subpopulations, suggesting the possibility of selecting families that combine fast growth, high wood density and drought tolerance.";;;;;;;;;10;0;9;0;10;0931-1890;;WOS:000182704000013;

This pressure could be alleviated by the establishment of trees in community/farm forests or more integrated agroforestry systems. Indigenous tree species are largely untried for these applications and represent an underexploited resource that may offer a good combination of tolerance of local environmental conditions, together with potential to restore degraded environments. These needs were addressed in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica in a study that combined: eliciting local people's knowledge about the utility of tree species for a wide range of products and services, assessment of the ecological characteristics of the tree species, and testing the establishment and growth of selected species over three and a half years in on-farm environments.Detailed interviews were conducted with 16 male and 11 female local respondents. Together they reported on the uses of 80 taxa of trees and shrubs, 43 of them indigenous (each respondent naming, on average, 19 taxa). All but one of the trees already present on farmland were exotic, but the majority of respondents were interested in planting more trees. The overall local valuations of each of the species were calculated for 10 uses. Timber and fruit were the highest rated individual uses but, for planting, multipurpose tree species were valued most highly. The respondents were familiar with most, but not all, of the indigenous species that have been recognised as having high commercial timber value.Farm environments on the southern slopes of the Blue Mountains are subject to significant drought as well as frequent disturbance from fire. Fifty-eight tree species indigenous to the montane forests were assessed for their potential suitability for growing in this environment by two indices of their distribution and three of their ecology. Their potential for timber production was also assessed in terms of their maximum size and wood density. Twenty-four of these species (together with one other indigenous timber species and the most highly valued exotic multipurpose tree species) were selected for a species elimination trial with a blocked structure replicated in two sites. After 42 months the species were strongly differentiated in terms of their rates of survival (from 0 to 48%), diameter growth (from 1.7 to 5.1 cm increment over the 42 months for the montane forest species), height growth (84-258 cm increment) and crown and stem form. Performance of most species in the trial could be explained post hoc by selective reference to their distribution and ecological traits in the natural montane forests. However, none of the traits taken alone provided accurate predictions of species' performance in the trial. The best prediction was provided by a classification of species' regeneration type with pioneer species tending to do better and shade-tolerant species worse, however there were many exceptions. No relationship was found between species' performance in the trial and their altitudinal range, abundance in southern slope forest, in secondary forests or on landslides, or their growth rate or maximum stem density in mature forest stands.From the combination of local valuation and trial performance 10 species are recommended for more detailed testing. Of the undomesticated indigenous species, Juniperus lucayana and Clethra occidentalis are particularly recommended, and it is suggested that Turpinia occidentalis, Cinnamomum montanum, Viburnum alpinum, Dendropanax arboreus, Podocarpus urbanii and Prunus occidentalis also be considered because of their good combination of establishment and utility. In addition, from the analysis of ecological characteristics a further 19 species (11 already known to be valued for their utility) are recommended for an additional trial.

Mill.]. In addition, the responses to PCT were measured and compared at several stem heights (0.2 m, 0.7 m, 1.3 m, 3 m, 5 m, 7 in, 9 in). Fifty-four trees were collected from plots subjected to moderate thinning (nominal stand density of 2,150 stems/ha), and light thinning (nominal stand density of 4,200 stems/ha), and from control plots. Ring width and wood density of individual rings were measured by X-ray densitometry. Our results show that in balsam fir the annual radial growth rate showed a positive response to PCT, especially in the low part of the stem (up to 5 in high), and this response lasted for 7 years. To achieve a significant increase in annual diameter growth in this species, however, a moderate thinning intensity is needed. This study also revealed that the response of annual radial growth to PCT was limited primarily to the earlywood width, whereas the latewood width showed little response. As a result, the latewood percentage was affected by the moderate thinning. The light thinning and the control plots, however, had a comparable earlywood width and latewood percentage. Both earlywood density and latewood density showed little response to PCT However, the wood density of growth rings tended to decrease following the moderate thinning, due to a decreased latewood percentage. In addition, the moderate thinning might somehow reduce the intra-ring variation in wood density and thus produce more uniform wood. This study also revealed that the responses to thinning in this species tended to weaken appreciably with increasing stem height. The remarkable responses were observed in the low part of the stem (up to 5 in high), whereas little response was found at the upper part of the stem. As a result, an increased stem taper may result from PCT in balsam fir.;;;;;;;;;23;0;13;0;23;0735-6161;;WOS:000178837600011;

Two segments (separated at a stem ratio of 0.60 of total height) depicted taper, volume, and weight variations of the stems as well. The taper function defines stem taper as a proportion of the diameter at breast height. The segmented volume equation was derived from integration of the taper function along the stem, and it can be readily transformed into a ratio volume equation. Likewise, the segmented weight equation was obtained from integration of the volume function and a wood density function. Data analysis showed that fertilization has significantly reduced taper (inside and outside bark) on the upper segment and augmented stem merchantable volume in this segment. However, unit-weight (green wood and bark, green wood only, and dry wood only) was not significantly different between fertilized and unfertilized trees, implying that annual fertilization did not reduce the specific gravity very much. Finally, our analysis showed no significant impacts of complete vegetation control on taper, volume or weight characteristics.;;;;;;;;;19;1;15;0;21;0015-749X;;WOS:000177433800012;

The impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbance since the late 1560s were examined for old-growth and logged forests.Location The study was conducted in montane Nothofagus alpina forests in the Andean Range of south-central Chile. Study sites were located at a range of altitudes between 1000 and 1250 m a.s.l.Methods Temporal variation in species recruitment and annual dendroecological data were used to determine the historical development and disturbance history of three old-growth forests, and three stands after selective logging in the late 1880s to early 1900s. Considering the spatial structure of evergreen vs. deciduous elements, the forests are a mixture of deciduous and evergreen tree species.Results Stem density, maximum stem diameter and basal area differed between the old-growth and logged stands, but species composition did not. At lower altitudes, N. alpina was the dominant canopy species in both old-growth and logged stands, but regeneration of N. alpina was significantly different in these stands. At higher altitudes, N. alpina and N. dombeyi were the dominant canopy species in both old-growth and logged stands, and here regeneration patterns of these Nothofagus species were similar. After selective logging, in mixed forests of shade-intolerant Nothofagus and more shade-tolerant trees (such as Laurelia philippiana ) there has been a shift in regeneration from more shade-tolerant resprouting species towards Nothofagus . Major and moderate releases in radial growth, indicative of disturbance, occurred in most of the older trees during the last four centuries, and especially during the last 100 years. Growth rates of N. alpina are higher than those of associated shade-tolerant trees, and apparently increase after disturbances.Main conclusions Results suggest that under disturbance regimes dominated by treefall gaps, and additionally canopy openings by selective logging, maintenance of Nothofagus species appears to be associated with complementary differences in growth rate, sprouting capacity, canopy residence time, and longevity. Such small-scale canopy openings may help explain the relative abundance of N. alpina in montane mixed rain forests in the Andean Range, where the maintenance of Nothofagus species in many stands has been attributed to a high frequency of coarse-scale disturbance. My results serve to emphasize that understanding the species coexistence and forest dynamics in Nothofagus forests may require attention to interspecific differences in life-history characteristics.;;;;;;;;;13;1;14;0;15;0305-0270;;WOS:000177026400012;

The review is split into three broad areas. The first covers the factors controlling wood quality that operate within the timber itself and also at the whole-tree scale. These include knots, grain angle, wood density, tracheid length, microfibril angle, juvenile wood and compression wood, tree/log size, growth rate, stem straightness and stem taper. The second section reviews the link between silviculture, site and genetics on these controlling factors and the consequences for wood quality for different end-uses. The silvicultural factors reviewed are rotation length, initial spacing, respacing before canopy closure, thinning after canopy closure, nursing mixtures, pruning, cultivation, weed suppression and fertilizer use. Site factors include site quality, wind, slope, and snow and ice. There is a brief section on the role of genetic improvement on timber quality. Finally, the review provides conclusions and recommends that stands should be identified as being suitable for sawlogs or fibre products and then managed consistently throughout the rotation with a strong focus on the final wood product. For Sitka spruce, the objective of maximizing volume yield appears to be compromising batten performance and buyers should consider premiums for stands where quality has been provided rather than quantity. Long-term forest plans and certification could play an increasing role in providing the assurance that good consistent silvicultural practice had been undertaken throughout the rotation, hence creating the possibility of offering clear premiums for high grade timber.;;;;;;;;;74;7;52;0;83;0015-752X;;WOS:000175692400001;

In the present study, radial gradients in SG were analysed for 20 species from nutrient-rich whitewater floodplains (varzea), including seven pioneer species, and for 15 species from nutrient-poor blackwater floodplains (igapo) in Central Amazonia. Average SG increased from pith to bark by 12% in the species from igapo, compared to 16% in the non-pioneers and 35% in the pioneers from varzea. The increases lie in the range of tropical dry forests. SG variation follows the growth strategies of the trees, The main trend in nutrient-rich varzea is fast growth, with low SG wood initially and higher increases in SG. In nutrient-poor igapo, the tendency is relatively constant, slow growth and low SG changes throughout tree life.;;;;;;;;;19;0;16;1;20;0928-1541;;WOS:000179590800007;

A summary of results from three decades of research and a discussion of how to use them;;;;;;;;INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW;;;;4;1;;;20;29;;;;;janv-02;2002;More than 60 Gmelina arborea provenance trials were established in the mid-seventies as a joint effort between 20 countries, mainly outside the natural distribution areas of gmelina. Results from 27 of these trials are presented in this article focusing on differences between seed sources in growth rate, bole quality and wood density. The results allow identification of provenances that in general perform well on a number of sites. More detailed results are found on Danida Forest Seed Centre's web-site (www.dfsc.dk), which show performance of provenances in specific trials and include information on more characters. An interesting observation is that plants originating from plantations often perform very well compared to those originating from natural forests. This can be due to (i) a positive selection during thinning in the plantations, (ii) a result of lower rates of inbreeding in the plantations, or (iii) a positive response to adaptation to local conditions (because the plantings often represent local 'landraces'). The presented results cannot clarify the relative importance of these factors, but all three factors suggest that important gains can be obtained by tree improvement programmes in gmelina. The second potential factor (release of inbreeding) suggests that such programmes should incorporate a broad genetic base. They may include hybrids of well-performing provenances, and maintain genetic diversity through advanced generations.;;;;;;;;;6;0;5;0;7;1465-5489;;WOS:000181048700003;

Mill.]. The relationships were studied at two different levels: 1) inter-tree level (between trees), and 2) intra-tree level (within a tree). In addition, juvenile-mature wood correlations for these characteristics were investigated. Wood density and annual ring width components of individual growth rings were measured by X-ray densitometry. Based on tree averages (at the inter-tree level), Wood density is significantly correlated With its components (earlywood density, latewood density) and latewood percentage in both juvenile Wood and mature wood; and earlywood density and latewood percentage are the two most important parameters in determining the overall wood density of the tree. Wood density, however, is not significantly correlated with annual growth rate (ring width) in either juvenile wood or mature wood, although a weakly negative correlation tends to strengthen in mature wood. This suggests that the relationship between wood density and annual growth rate in this species may vary with cambial age. Intra-ring wood density variation (IDV) shows a positive correlation With wood density traits, latewood width, and latewood percentage in both juvenile wood and mature wood, whereas a weakly negative correlation of IDV with ring width and earlywood width exists, in balsam fir. Latewood traits are the most important parameters in determining the intra-ring wood density uniformity. At the intra-tree level (based on ring averages within a tree), relationships between wood density components and ring width components are similar to those found between the trees, although some relationships, to some extent, vary with tree. For each wood density trait, the juvenile-mature wood correlation is significant but moderate. For this species, earlywood density in juvenile wood seems to be the best parameter for predicting mature wood density.";;;;;;;;;21;1;10;0;22;0735-6161;;WOS:000173585800014;

Interpretation of Near Infrared Spectroscopy data using partial least squares regression;;;;;;;;WOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;;;;35;6;;;475;485;;;;;DEC 2001;2001;"This work was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and partial least squares regression (PLS) as a tool to characterize the basic wood properties of Norway Spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The wood samples originated from a trial located in the province of Vasterbotten in Sweden. In this trial, the effects of birch shelterwoods (Betula pendula Roth) of different densities on growth and yield in Norway spruce understorey were examined. All Norway spruce trees in each shelterwood treatment were divided into three growth rate classes based on diameter at breast height (1.3 m) over bark. Five discs were cut from each tree (i.e. from the root stem, and at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the total height). The discs from 40% tree height were used (i.e., where the largest variations in annual ring widths and wood density were found). A total of 27 discs were selected. The discs were used for measuring annual ring widths, wood density, average fiber length and the fiber length distributions. Milled wood samples prepared from the discs were used for recording NIR spectra. PLS regression was used to generate prediction models for the wood properties (Y-matrix) and NIR spectra (X-matrix) as well as between the wood properties (Y-matrix) and the fiber length distributions (X-matrix). One set of models was generated using untreated spectra and fiber length distributions. For a second set of models the structure in the X-matrix, which was orthogonal to the matrix described by the wood properties, was eliminated using a soft target rotation technique called orthogonal signal correction OSC. The PLS model obtained using ""raw"" untreated NIR spectra and fiber length distributions had a poor modeling power as evidenced by the cumulative Q(2) values. For the PLS models based on untreated NIR spectra the cumulative Q(2) values ranged from a minimum of 16% (wood density) to a maximum of 46% (no. of annual rings). Orthogonal signal correction of the X-matrix (NIR spectra or fiber length distributions) gave PLS models with a modeling power corresponding to cumulative Q(2) values well in excess of 70%. The improvement in predictive ability accomplished by the OSC procedure was verified by placing four of the 27 observations in an external test set and comparing RMSEP values for the test set observations without OSC and with OSC.";;;;;;;;;45;6;7;2;49;0043-7719;;WOS:000173020200001;

A 1998 emergence of M. cassini in eastern Kansas led to colonization of a fragmented experimental landscape undergoing secondary succession. We hypothesized that per-tree rates of oviposition damage by cicadas would reflect: (1) distance from the source of the emergence, (2) patch size, and (3) local tree density. Ovipositing females displayed clear preferences for host species and damage incidence showed predictable spatial patterns. Two species (smooth sumac, Rhus glabra, and eastern red cedar, Juniperus virginiana) were rarely attacked, whereas others ( rough-leaved dogwood, Cornus drummondii; slippery elm, Ulmus rubra; box elder, Acer negundo, and honey locust, Gleditsia triacanthos) were strongly attacked. The dominant early successional tree, dogwood, received on average the most attacks. As predicted, attacks per stem declined strongly with distance from the emergence source, and with local stem density (a ""dilution"" effect). Contrary to expectations, there were more attacks per stem on larger patches. Because ovipositing cicadas cut damaging slits in host tree branches, potentially affecting tree growth rate, competitive ability, and capacity to reproduce, cicada damage could potentially influence spatial variation in secondary succession.";;;;;;;;;19;0;17;0;19;0029-8549;;WOS:000167629200006;

Three types of littoral zone were applied: with homogeneous macrophytes (HOM), with heterogeneous macrophytes (HEM) and with woody debris (WD), together with control enclosure - without any structure (C). The type of littoral zone influenced the growth rate and behaviour of YOY pikeperch. The growth rates of small (<60 mm) pikeperch were significantly higher in HOM than in controls, HEM and WD types of littoral. Similar but weaker relationships were found for larger pikeperch (>60 mm) with their growth rates higher in HOM than in HEM and WD littoral types. At the presence of pike, the highest pikeperch growth rate was still noted in HOM, compared to WD enclosures. The results of pikeperch diurnal behaviour showed high littoral use at absence of pike (on average: 38% for C, 62% for HOM, 55% for WD, and 30% for HEM enclosures). Pikeperch utilised littoral habitat much less at presence of pike (15% for C, 8% for HOM, 3% for WD, 6% for HEM enclosures). On the basis of experiments it can be concluded that pikeperch growth rate and behaviour may be strongly affected by diversified littoral zones and by the presence of pike competition. Observed relationships may be applied for water quality control in reservoir. As a strong pikeperch population, achieved by enhancement of its growth through creation of most preferred nursery habitat (HOM), may enable to reduce zooplanktivorous fish community even in the presence of pike competition.;;;;;;;;;2;0;1;0;2;1642-3593;;BCI:BCI200200349989;

Don (+ control seedlot) at seven sites after 22 years of growth. The sites ranged from Taringatura, in the deep south of New Zealand (lat. 46degreeS; mean annual temperature 10.1degreeC), to Woodhill (lat. 35degreeS; mean annual temperature 14.6degreeC), and covered an altitudinal range of 650 m. The cores were resin-extracted and scanned in a wood densitometer to yield a continuous density trace across all annual growth rings. Sample data were analysed by family and site to determine the influence of genotype and environment on growth ring density components. There were significant site effects for both growth rate and wood density, which broadly corresponded to expected patterns, but little correlation between the two variables. Average wood density at Woodhill reached ""mature"" levels (defined as 400 kg/m3) well before age 10 years whereas the southernmost site, Taringatura, failed to reach this level even after 20 years. Percentage latewood proved to be the most sensitive variable in both juvenile and mature wood, and was reflected in the site values for average wood density. Site differences in earlywood and latewood density were comparatively small. Family ranks for density traits averaged across all sites maintained a high degree of consistency and moderate-to-high heritabilities, but analyses of variance also revealed a significant GXE component. The range in family density means of about 50 kg/m3 remained consistent from pith to bark across sites. There were large differences in the ability of individual families to reach ""mature"" levels of wood density. Families varied in the period required for mature wood initiation (8 to 20 years).";;;;;;;;;15;0;11;0;17;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI200100475310;

We compared the selection efficiency obtained when using an index that included the phenotype and marker score with that obtained using only the phenotype. It was assumed that MAS was restricted to within-family selection, that the rotation age was 50 years, and that growth rate (h(2) = 0.25), tree form (h(2) = 0.25), and (or) wood density (h(2) = 0.45) were the objects of improvement. Several population quantitative trait loci (QTL) models, selection population sizes, and interest rates were considered. When large selection population sizes were employed (500 trees per family) MAS gave considerable increases in efficiency of within-family selection; however, results showed that the combination of small selection population sizes (100 trees per family) and many QTL of moderate effect could lead to losses in gain from MAS compared with phenotypic selection. For many reasonable selection scenarios and the simplified assumptions in our model, the land base required for breeding programs to break-even is smaller or near to the limit of those in place under operational breeding programs in the region. Considerably more research is needed to reasonably predict whether MAS would be cost-effective in practice. However, before some of the basic research needed to implement MAS can be done, organizations need to establish large blocks of full-sib families to allow for QTL identification.";;;;;;;;;11;1;14;0;15;0045-5067;;WOS:000165708700012;

The demographic study was conducted in scrub oak and hardwood plant communities on an extensive sand plain, where it was possible to control for the effect of variation in environment prior to land use.3 The observed demographic effects were contrary to the hypothesis that persistent environmental alteration depressed demographic performance and limited the distribution of G. procumbens. We observed no overall effect of land-use history on stem density, stem recruitment or flower production. In fact, some aspects of performance were enhanced in previously ploughed areas. Populations in previously ploughed areas exhibited less stem mortality in scrub oak transitions, an increase in germination, seedling longevity and proportion of potentially reproductive stems in both plant communities, a trend for slower observed rates of population decline in both plant communities, and a higher projected rate of population growth in the scrub oak transitions. Thus, particularly in scrub oak communities, the lower abundance of G. procumbens in formerly ploughed than in unploughed areas contrasted with its performance.4 The limited occurrence of G. procumbens in formerly farmed areas was explained instead by its slow intrinsic growth rate, coupled with limited seedling establishment. Lateral population extension occurred exclusively through vegetative growth, allowing a maximum expansion of 43 cm year(-1.)5 We conclude that inherent limitations in the colonizing ability of some plant species may present a major obstacle in the restoration or recovery of plant communities on intensively disturbed sites, even in the absence of persistent environmental effects that depress population growth.;;;;;;;;;53;1;53;0;56;0022-0477;;WOS:000086271800010;

Microdensitometry was used to record variations in wood density, whereas fibre properties and kraft pulp strength properties were measured on laboratory-made batches of unbleached kraft pulp. The main conclusion of the investigation is that a birch shelterwood has only a minor influence on the wood and fibre properties of sheltered Norway spruce and that the resulting consequences for kraft pulping are moderate. Length-weighted mean fibre length was significantly affected only by growth rate. It was 1.75 mm, or 6-13% lower, for trees showing a low growth rate than for all other trees. Tensile index was already high before refining, 85-95 Nm g(-1), and the increase due to beating was similar for all shelterwood densities and growth rate classes. At 2000 beating revolutions, there was a strong negative correlation between tear index and the proportion of fibres shorter than 0.20 mm. The volume of wood required to produce 1 t of kraft pulp was almost identical, 5.4 +/- 0.1 m(3) t(-1), for sheltered and unsheltered spruce. Norway spruce growing without shelter produced more pulp per hectare in all fibre length classes, but the difference was greatest, 56-59% compared with sheltered spruce, for the longest fibres (i.e., longer than 3 mm).;;;;;;;;;10;0;5;0;10;0045-5067;;WOS:000086044500016;

The Omataroa trial was badly frosted during the first winter and was abandoned after frost scoring. The Parakao trial was assessed for diameter at breast height 1.4 in (dbh), bole straightness, forking, and crown health at ages 2 and 6 years, and height and wood density of a subsample were measured at age 6. There were significant differences between provenances at Parakao at both ages for all traits except dbh and wood density at age 6. Family differences, not generally significant at age 2, were highly significant for all traits at age 6. Heritability (narrow-sense) at age 6 varied from 0.10 for straightness to 0.26 for health. Family mean heritability varied from 0.50 for diameter increment to 0.62 for health. Growth rate and crown health were good; overall mean dbh was 200 mm and mean height of dominants and codominants was 15 m by age 6 at the Northland site. The main deficiencies were the initially low survival (50% at Parakao) caused variously by possum browsing and frost, and stem malformation caused by forking and top breakage. It was concluded that the potential for gain from combined selection using provenance, family, and individual performance was good for all traits but that the trial contained too little material on which to base a future breeding programme.

B.S.P.]. The ring density components are significantly correlated to their respective ring width components: earlywood and ring densities are negatively correlated to ring and earlywood widths, respectively, while ring and latewood densities are positively correlated to latewood width. These hold true in both juvenile and mature wood, However, the correlation between ring width and ring density decreases with increasing age. This suggests that the correlation between wood density and growth rate tends to lessen as the tree ages. For each character, the correlation between juvenile and mature wood is significant but moderate. Thus, juvenile wood characters are only indicative of mature wood ones. On the other hand, trees with 12 growth rings from the pith were good predictors of wood density and radial growth of the whole tree. Individual growth rings from the juvenile-mature wood transition zone can be used to predict to some extent the wood density of either mature wood or the whole tree.;;;;;;;;;22;0;11;0;22;0735-6161;;WOS:000084799700010;

(31 seedlots) and A. mearnsii de Wildeman (23 seedlots), together with one or a few seedlots each of A. decurrens (Wendl.) Willd., A. falciformis D.C., A. filicifolia Cheel. and Welch ex Welch, A. melanoxylon R.Br., and A. silvestris Tind. were planted at five sites in 1989 and at two sites in 1991. All trials were assessed in 1996 at ages 7 years and 5 years (for 1991-planted trials) for diameter at breast height (dbh), bole straightness (score 1-9), and malformation (score 1-5). A small subsample of trees from seven seedlots each of A. mearnsii (from two sites) and of A. dealbata (from three sites) were assessed for height, dbh, and wood density (5-mm pith-to-bark cores) at age 7 years. Acacia dealbata and A. mearnsii greatly outgrew the other species, and were of much better form than all except A. silvestris. Both A. dealbata and A. mearnsii showed large and significant differences between seedlots (mostly provenances) in diameter growth and bole straightness, and A. dealbata did in malformation. For A. dealbata trials aged 7 years, overall mean dbh varied from 206 mm at Kinleith to 145 mm at Tuki Tuki (Havelock North); for A. mearnsii (not assessed at Kinleith), site mean dbh ranged from 151 mm at Tuki Tuki to 135 mm at Pohangina (Palmerston North). Averaged across three sites, dbh of the best three seedlots of A. dealbata was 175 mm compared with over 162 mm for the best three seedlots of A. mearnsii. The seedlots of A. dealbata with better growth and form were reasonably free of malformation and their bole straightness was acceptable for sawlogs. All seedlots of A. mearnsii were much more sinuous in stem form than A. dealbata, such that very few trees would be straight enough for sawlogs. Height of A. dealbata averaged 12 m at Tuki Tuki and up to 15 m at Kinleith. Height of A. mearnsii averaged 12 m at Tuki Tuki and Emerald Hills. Basic wood density of A. dealbata averaged 369 kg/m3 at Kinleith, 371 kg/m3 at Emerald Hills, and 412 kg/m3 at Tuki Tuki. By contrast, wood density of A. mearnsii averaged 553 kg/m3 at Tuki Tuki and 556 kg/m3 at Emerald Hills. There was substantial variation between seedlots in both species, with a range of 348 to 437 kg/m3 for A. dealbata (averaged over three sites) and of 521 to 573 kg/m for A. mearnsii (over two sites). The better provenances of A. dealbata show promise for sawlog and pulpwood production, based on rapid growth rate, acceptable bole straightness and wood density, and (from other work) good sawing, seasoning, and appearance characteristics. The rapid growth rates and high wood density of A. mearnsii in New Zealand, as well as existing market acceptance of South African material for pulp, indicate a real potential for this species for pulpwood.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI200100336697;

Patterns of resource allocation during growth and reproduction reflect life-history differences between species(1,2). This is particularly striking in tropical forests, where tree species can differ greatly in their rates of growth and ages of maturity but still attain similar canopy sizes(3,4). Here we provide a theoretical framework for relating life-history variables to rates of production, dM/dt, where M is above-ground mass and t is time. As metabolic rate limits production as an individual grows, dM/dt proportional to M-3/4. Incorporating interspecific variation in resource allocation to wood density, we derive a universal growth law that quantitatively fits data for a large sample of tropical tree species with diverse life histories. Combined with evolutionary life-history theory(1), the growth law also predicts several qualitative features of tree demography and reproduction. This framework also provides a general quantitative answer to why relative growth rate (1/M)(dM/df) decreases with increasing plant size (proportional to M-1/4) and how it varies with differing allocation strategies(5-8).;;;;;;;;;282;20;255;2;308;0028-0836;;WOS:000083464700056;
WD;J;Yin, XW;;;;;;;;The decay of forest woody debris: numerical modeling and implications based on some 300 data cases from North America;;;;;;;;OECOLOGIA;;;;121;1;;;81;98;;10.1007/s004420050909;;;oct-99;1999;"The decay rate of forest woody debris (WD) is a key missing link for a quantitative understanding of forest carbon dynamics and the global carbon budget. This paper reports an attempt to synthesize the available information into a unifying and testable numerical model pertinent to the analysis and projection of WD decay in field conditions. The model is rooted in an integrative theory that depicts decay as a process of substrate quality degradation along with feedback responses of microbial activity. It is parameterized through regression analysis against 112 data cases of stem and branch WD decay in North America, and then is evaluated against 132 additional data cases for stem and branch WD, and 75 data cases for root WD decay. The root mean square errors of both the fitted and the projected WD decay rates are about 14% of the means of respective data sets. Aided by peripheral algorithms, the model solves WD decay with data requirements limited to (1) tree species, and (2) air temperature and precipitation in January and July for forested sites, plus (3) latitude and elevation for deforested sites. The mathematical and physical implications of the model by its component functions and as a whole are generally supported by independent evidence from the literature where available. Those implications include: (I) the observed decay rate is lower when defined by density loss than by mass loss, when inferred from chronosequence survey than from population monitoring, or when estimated with specimens with end-coating than without coating; (2) the initial quality of WD differs between Abies/Picea and other species among conifers, or along the gradients of shade tolerance and normal stem slenderness among the deciduous trees; (3) the basic microbial growth rate (the rate at a WD quality of unity) increases with ambient temperature but decreases along the gradients of July precipitation-to-potential evapotranspiration ratio and January precipitation under forested conditions; and (4) WD decay may be accelerated or hampered after canopy removal, depending on local air humidity. The model further suggests that the lower of substrate quality and the basic microbial growth rate exerts a proportionally greater constraint on the decay rate, so the difference in WD decay by substrate and site narrows as the substrate quality degrades over time. Thus, a 2 degrees C warming in air temperature would accelerate stem WD decay by 9-55% across the data sites for the Ist year, but only 1-14% by year 100.";;;;;;;;;49;2;36;0;53;0029-8549;;WOS:000083131600010;

The mean values of the modulus of elasticity (MOE), density, age, and rings per centimeter were determined for each. Mathematical models were developed to predict the MOE from the other parameters, Linear models are first presented showing the dependence of MOE on each of the three parameters, density, age, and rings per centimeter. A multivariate linear regression model is then developed for MOE as a function of all three parameters. The correlation coefficient of this model is 0.66, an improvement over each of the models for which each parameter is taken individually. A prediction of MOE by visual means alone, i.e., using only age and rings per centimeter in a linear model, is also presented. The correlation coefficient of this model is 0.58, which is superior to any of the parameters taken individually. In order to develop a model useful for extrapolation beyond the range of test data, a nonlinear model is presented. The parameters of this nonlinear model can easily he interpreted in terms of (1) the maximum attainable stiffness, (2) the ring age for maximum MOE growth rate vs, age, and (3) the shape parameter of the model. We found that the nonlinear model marched the data well and incorporated the realistic conditions of zero MOE at zero ring age and a limit on the maximum attainable MOE.;;;;;;;;;13;1;8;0;14;0735-6161;;WOS:000083072600007;

Carr.), on growth rate, stem form, branching habit and wood properties of the spruce. These mixtures were compared with pure stands of Sitka spruce which had been regularly and periodically fertilised with nitrogen. Hybrid larch promoted diameter increments in Sitka spruce greater than those achieved by the other treatments over the last 12 years of the experiment (current age 30 years). Growth of regularly fertilised pure Sitka spruce was not significantly greater than that of periodically fertilised pure spruce, suggesting that regular applications of nitrogen fertiliser did not result in increased stem growth. The greatest increase in growth of the larch-nursed spruce occurred during the period immediately following canopy closure, thus demonstrating the failure of the larch to compete with the spruce crowns. This period of high growth was associated with a high branch, cross-sectional area and deep knots within the wood on the lower part of the spruce stems in comparison with other treatments. While each treatment was associated with a similar number of branches, lodgepole pine-nursed spruce had more small branches (0-10 mm diameter) and fewer big branches (>20 mm diameter) compared with other treatments, highlighting the capacity of lodgepole pine to control branch development of the spruce. Spruce trees nursed by larch had deeper and more imbalanced living crowns with longer lived branches in comparison with lodgepole pine-nursed spruce, and both the pure spruce treatments, suggesting that more juvenile wood may have formed within the stem. Larch-nursed spruce also had the highest stem taper and lodgepole pine-nursed spruce the lowest. Basic wood density was not influenced by treatments.Overall, the evidence from this study suggests that the use of larch as a nursing species on deep peats is inadvisable and that Alaskan lodgepole pine is better able to control the branching habit of Sitka spruce with the prospect of better quality sawlogs in the future, albeit with a lower average tree size. Periodically fertilised pure spruce appears to maintain a growth rate consistently above that of the lodgepole pine-nursed spruce but without many of the disadvantages linked with the regularly fertilised pure spruce, particularly the development of large branches and an irregular pattern of annual rings within the wood.

This is formulated and implemented within the framework of an existing tree plantation growth model: the ITE Edinburgh Forest Model. It is proposed that the height:diameter growth rate ratio is a function of a within-plant allocation ratio determined by the transport-resistance model of partitioning, multiplied by a foliage turgor pressure modifier. First it is demonstrated that the method leads to a stable long-term growth trajectory. Diurnal and seasonal dynamics are also examined. Predicted time courses over 20 years of stem mass, stem height, height:diameter ratio, and height:diameter growth rate ratio are presented for six treatments: control, high nitrogen, Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, increased planting density, increased temperature and decreased rainfall. High nitrogen and increased temperature give initially higher stem height:diameter ratios, whereas high CO2 gives an initially lower stem height:diameter ratio. However, the responses are complex, reflecting interactions between factors which often have opposing influences on height:diameter ratios, for example: stem density, competition for light and for nitrogen; carbon dioxide and decreased water stress; rainfall, leaching and nitrogen nutrition. The approach relates stem height and diameter growth variables via internal plant variables to environmental and management variables. Potentially, a coherent view of many observations which are sometimes in apparent conflict is provided. These aspects of plant growth can be considered more mechanistically than has hitherto been the case, providing an alternative to the empirical or teleonomic methods which have usually been employed.

Fifty-four 100-m(2) plots were sampled along 25 transects laid out perpendicular to Lake Duparquet, In each plot, all black ash >5 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were aged using dendrochronological methods. An age-height regression was used to calculate the age of those individuals <5 cm in dbh. Stump sprouts had a significantly faster height and diameter growth rate than individuals established from sexual origin. Two stands in this study showed deficits in sexual recruitment. One stand, located on a deep organic layer, also showed recent colonization by F. nigra that may have started during the 1930s. This stand had the highest stem density, and sprouting was restricted to the younger age classes. Ordination analysis of dispersion indices characterizing the age distribution of F. nigra indicated a definite pattern toward higher sexual recruitment in plots and stands that were less exposed to flooding. In contrast, poor sexual recruitment was observed on more exposed sites. However, this situation was compensated for by abundant vegetative recruitment, Analysis of the periods of growth release and suppression of 153 trees revealed that F. nigra population dynamics are not regulated by major disturbance events. A general upward trend in radial growth and F. nigra expansion toward higher elevation sites observed since the end of the 19th century may be due to changes in Lake Duparquet's hydrological regime. Increases in the severity of flooding events may result in the decrease in seedling abundance observed in the more exposed stands. F. nigra populations were found to be resistant to long-term natural water fluctuations due to their ability to regenerate both by seeds and by sprouts.;;;;;;;;;28;0;22;1;28;d_c-15;;WOS:000078484900005;

Variations in vessel lumen size, vessel number mm(-2), and total lumen area mm(-2) were analysed in ten trees. Since density increased by only 0.005 g cm(-3) per mm increase in ring width, silvicultural practices such as initial spacing and thinning are not likely to have a substantial effect on the wood density of rauli. Similarly, variation in density with cambial age was significant but relatively minor in the 40- and 60-year old trees of the present sample, suggesting that the rotation length is unlikely to have any practical influence on the density of rauli. Considerable between-tree differences in density were found which did not correspond to differences in ring width, suggesting it should be feasible to select independently for density and growth rate. These differences in density were associated with differences in both vessel lumen size and vessel number mm(-2).;;;;;;;;;7;2;7;0;9;0018-3830;;WOS:000079492300016;

Karst.], randomly sampled as 7 fast-grown and 7 slow-grown trees, were used to test whether an increased tree growth rate in circumference affects the intra-ring and inter-ring trajectories of the microfibril angle in the S-2 layer of the tracheid wall. Those trajectories describe the fluctuations of the S-2 microfibril angle, respectively, from earlywood to latewood within rings and from pith to bark among rings. Using the cross-field pit apertures, intra-ring measures of microfibril angle were made at 11 equally-spaced sampling sites over each of 8 growth rings, following an 11 x 8 doubly repeated measures design with the tree as the 'subject' on which repeated measures were made. All the intra-ring trajectories of microfibril angle decreased linearly from earlywood to latewood, whereas the intra-ring trajectories showed significant year effects. Both types of trajectories are significantly affected by the growth rate after first thinning, as the fast-grown spruces showed a systematically larger microfibril angle and a mean microfibril angle of 29 degrees compared to 21 degrees for the slow-grown spruces. Thus, lower tensile and tear strengths of tracheids as well as some modifications of the mechanical properties of solid wood and paper can be expected from Norway spruces growing faster than 2.2 cm/year in circumference.;;;;;;;;;20;1;13;0;21;0928-1541;;WOS:000079491500001;

Increase in density across the juvenile wood was mainly associated with an increase in fibre wall %, which outbalanced a simultaneous increase in vessel lumen %. Decrease in density across the mature wood was associated with changes in both fibre wall and total lumen percentages. Though density varied only slightly with ring width, this was accompanied by appreciable changes in percentages of different cell types. These trends in the wall and lumen percentages of the various cell types suggest that some physical properties may vary more within the tree (or with growth rate) than is suggested by the limited variation in density that is found in rauli. There were significant between-tree variations in both density and cell types, indicating the possibility of selection for either at an early stage of tree growth.;;;;;;;;;7;0;5;1;8;0928-1541;;WOS:000079491500002;

Karst.) understorey were evaluated for a trial in the boreal coniferous forest 56 years after establishment of the stand and 19 years after establishment of the trial. Wood density traits were measured by micro-densitometry for annual rings 21-30 extracted at breast height. In addition, ring width and mean density were measured for all annual rings. Growth rate was generally low with a mean ring width of 1.3 mm. Radial variations in ring width and density depended more on calendar year than on cambial age. The shelterwoods had moderate d fluctuations in ring width, but not in wood density. For annual rings 21-30, the mean density was 12 % higher in trees of the lowest growth rate compared to trees of the highest growth rate. Also, minimum density anti latewood percentage were higher in trees with the lowest growth rate compared to all other trees, while then were no significant effects due to shelterwood treatment for any of the wood density baits tested. An increase in ring width from I to 2 mm resulted in an 18 % decrease in wood density. Latewood percentage explained 84 % of the variation in wood density.

Of various variance components of the intertree variation, a remarkable variance component due to family was found in wood density characteristics (viz. average wood density, average earlywood density and latewood density of the tree), and these characteristics are thus under strong genetic control (h(i)(2) ranging from 0.60 to 0.86, and h(f)(2) from 0.56 to 0.68). It, to a lesser extent, applies to ring width characteristics at the tree level (viz. average ring width, and average earlywood width, latewood width and latewood percent of the tree) that show a lower heritability (h(i)(2) from 0.18 to 0.28, and h(f)(2) from 0.22 to 0.36). Both block and block x family interaction contribute little to the total intertree variation encountered in 40 families from 9 blocks, while tree-to-tree variation within the family accounts for most (over 3/4) of the total intertree variation.Compared to the intertree variation (tree-to-tree variation within the family), the intratree variation in various wood characteristics studied is considerably larger in this species. It appears that most intraring wood density characteristics show a relatively smaller intertree variation but a relatively larger intratree variation as compared to ring width characteristics (except latewood width and latewood percent). Latewood width and latewood percent show the smallest intertree variation and the largest intratree variation. Between the two sources of the radial intratree variation, cambial age explains much more variation in most intraring wood density characteristics, while ring width accounts for more variation in earlywood width, latewood width and intraring density variation. This indicates that wood density of growth rings in this species is dependent more on cambial age than ring width (growth rate). Among various wood density and ring width characteristics studied, maximum (latewood) density shows the strongest response to calendar year. This characteristic is thus a useful dendroclimatic parameter In this species.;;;;;;;;;15;0;6;0;15;0043-7719;;WOS:000073025600007;

Basic densities were 42 kg.m(3) and 79 kg.m(-3) higher, bleached kraft pulp yields decreased by 3.4 and 1.8 percentage points, fibre lengths decreased by up to 0.1 mm and bleached kraft pulp strength properties were lower. Less extreme water restrictions at another site were associated with 10-22% slower growth in E, occidentalis, E. grandis and E, camaldulensis. Basic densities increased by about 20 kg.m(-3) and bleached kraft pulp yields decreased by about 2 percentage points compared with corresponding controls,Under conditions of high soil salinity, E. camaldulensis showed 6% reduction in growth rate, 37 kg.m(-3) increase in wood basic density and 1 percentage point reduction in bleached kraft pulp yield, compared with controls grown under lower salinities. At another site, the same species irrigated with saline water showed a small increase in wood density, but kraft pulp yields were not consistently affected. The application of fertilizer was a more important factor, producing a positive effect on tree growth and wood density but reducing kraft pulp yield and fibre length.It was concluded that the effects of salinity on E. camaldulensis may be of a similar nature to those of reduced water availability. However, the magnitudes of the effects appeared to be related to the severity of the conditions and to the tolerance of the species, so that if growth was unaffected, differences in pulpwood properties were less likely to be significant.;;;;;52nd Appita Annual General Conference;MAY 11-14, 1998;Appita;BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA;0;0;0;0;0;;0-9585548-0-3;WOS:000074690000029;

Karst.) from an even-aged, plantation-grown stand near Rendeux, Belgian Ardennes. The objective was to test whether increasing the growth rate of Norway spruce by heavy thinnings had an effect on the temporal trajectories (i.e., fluctuations from year to year) of ring width, wood density, and mean tracheid length, all measured yearly from pith to bark. Since the data were chronologies (i.e., time series of yearly measurements), time had to be considered as a factor (i.e., the calendar year of ring formation) in the statistical analysis of the within-tree variation (repeated measures analysis of variance).While the effects of the growth category and its interaction with the year were highly significant after first thinning for ring width, a significant decrease in the wood density of fast-grown trees was observed in many years during that growing period; the decrease was small in magnitude, once averaged over years (-0.033 g/cm(3)). Tracheids were longer for the slow-grown trees after first thinning; although constant in sign and magnitude over years, the difference in mean tracheid length between growth categories was not statistically significant. In summary, increasing the growth rate in circumference of Norway spruce from 1.7 to 2.7 cm/year by heavy thinnings induced a limited decrease in wood density and mean tracheid length. These results support the statement that stand productivity might be improved without sensible loss of wood quality.";;;;;;;;;39;2;26;0;41;0735-6161;;WOS:000071913200002;

Clones, heights, and the position of annual rings from pith had significant effects on average fiber length. Individual tree broad-sense heritability was 0.41. The main source of variation was the position of annual rings from pith, which accounted for about 80% of total variance. Fiber length increased from pith to bark for all sampled heights. For a given annual ring, fiber length was low at the bottom of the tree and tended to reach a maximum at mid-height. Weighted average fiber length at breast height was significantly correlated to weighted average fiber length of the merchantable stem. Finally, the correlation between fiber length and growth rate varied over the age of the tree.

Results indicated that differences in growth rate, caused by differences in planting espacement, appear to have a very pronounced effect on overall wood density as well as its within-tree variability. It is important to bear in mind, however, that this result reflects the wood properties of trees grown under conditions that are very different from those created by current management and silvicultural practices. Within the range of normal spacing variation, the effect of spacing on wood density and pulp and paper properties seems to be minimal, suggesting that the enhancement of growth rate by the manipulation of the growing space, has no adverse effect on wood density, and by implication, on any of the factors related to density. The results obtained suggest that within-tree uniformity in fact improves by accelerated growth. Stand density has almost no effect on pulp properties, but manipulation of the rotation age seems to be a very effective way to manipulate the quality of pulpwood view of the good relationship found between the age of a tree and its pulp and paper properties.;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;BCI:BCI199800120401;

In an analysis of a size/age series of each species across the whole floodplain (both mature and successional stands), stem growth rate was lowest for Tamarix. However, along the same successional chronosequence, Tamarix came to dominate the 50 + year old stands with dense thickets of high stem density. Xylem sap flow, when expressed on a sapwood area basis, was highest in Tamarix under early drought conditions, but comparable between the four species toward the end of the summer dry season. Multivariate analysis of the gas exchange data indicated that the four species differentiated based on water use under early drought conditions and separated based on plant water potential and leaf temperature (indices of drought effects) at the end of the summer dry season. This analysis suggests that the invasive Tamarix is the most drought tolerant of the four species, whereas Salix transpires the most water per unit leaf surface area and is the least tolerant of seasonal water stress. Therefore, Salix appears to be well adapted to early successional communities. However, as floodplains in this arid region become more desiccated with age, Tamarix assumes greater dominance due to its superior drought tolerance relative to native phreatophytes and its ability to produce high density stands and high leaf area.;;;;;;;;;116;14;99;2;132;0029-8549;;WOS:A1997XF86000002;

Carr) were analysed in relation to within-tree trends in tracheid diameter and cell wall thickness. Discs were sampled at breast height from a total of 24 trees, from seven stands at three contrasting sites in Wales, and at breast height, 30 per cent and 60 per cent total tree height from one of the stands.Across the juvenile wood, ring density decreased with ring number from the pith while radial tracheid diameter increased. These overall trends were considered to be inherent to tree growth, presumably associated with cambial ageing, since they occurred in all trees on all sites. In juvenile wood, density also varied with site growth rate (as indicated by ring width) at similar cambial age, wider rings being associated with more rapid rate of change in tracheid diameter with ring number and with decrease in tracheid wall thickness. Consequently, on a site having trees with high growth rate density decreased more rapidly across the juvenile wood, down to a lower minimum value, than on sites with a slower growth rate. In mature wood, the decrease in density with increase in ring width was associated with differences in both tracheid diameter and wall thickness. Density was slightly (though not significantly) higher at breast height than in comparable rings at 30 per cent total height, associated with significantly thicker tracheid walls at breast height.Changes in radial tracheid diameter (with ring number, or with ring width) were associated with greater differences in the earlywood than towards the latewood end of each growth ring, while variations in wall thickness with ring width were associated with rate of increase in wall thickness towards the latewood end. This may account for some previously conflicting reports on influence of silvicultural management on density, for density is likely to vary with influence of environment on the seasonal cycle of cambial activity.The extent of the juvenile wood as delimited by the inner core of wide growth rings does not necessarily correspond to the region of varying tracheid dimensions in Sitka spruce.;;;;;;;;;25;0;17;0;25;0015-752X;;WOS:A1997WJ74400005;

As the end-use properties of forest products greatly depend on wood characteristics, such as tracheid length, tracheid diameter, microfibril angle, and basic density, there is increasing concern to foresee how silvicultural regulation of growth conditions alters wood properties.In this study, a fertilization trial near Strasan, central Sweden, six net parcels of Norway spruce (Picea abies), planted in 1957 and clear-felled in the winter of 1989/1990, were used to evaluate the influence of varying growth conditions on basic density. Growth rate of each parcel had been regulated by annual dressings of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients.The basic density, kg/m(3), of individual growth rings at breast height, from pith outwards, using suppressed, intermediate, and dominant trees sampled from each parcel, was evaluated in different modeling approaches. In a modeling attempt based on growth conditions, site quality, initial stand density, thinning, tree class, climate, and cambial age were, separately or in interaction, found significant for basic density development with r(2)=0.46-0.63.

Growth rate had been regulated by annual dressings of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The six parcels represented two unfertilized, two medium, and two heavily fertilized treatments. Various thinning procedures were applied to each stand in 1982 and 1988. Based on the author's published paper of cambial activity regulation, this study focused on variables related to crown development and basic density. Three sets of predictors were used: stem taper, mean ring width, and factors related to crown development. Stem taper was found to be a significant predictor of basic density, with r(2) varying from 0.34 to 0.60, depending on the form of the model. Mean ring width was found to be a significant predictor of basic density, with r(2) = 0.61. Mean ring width was found dependent on factors related to crown development. Tree height, diameter outside bark, tree height x diameter outside bark, site quality, stand density, and thinning procedure were found to be significant predictors of growth ring width, with r(2) = 0.95. Factors related to crown development were used in a multivariate regression model in which tree height, tree height x diameter on bark, and thinning procedure were found to be significant predictors of basic density, with r(2) = 0.68 at tree level.

Observations from permanent remeasured plots indicate that a closed canopy formed and completely shaded the ground by 10-1 5 yr. Data gathered before that time did provide general information about features like the proportion of area stocked with trees and the stem density. After canopy closure, no new species entered the stand. Yet the actual species composition continued to change throughout the 20 yr period. Additional changes will occur as relatively short-lived species like striped maple, pin cherry, and aspen die. For other species, the change of importance will continue to depend on differences in their growth rates and tolerance to shading. Collectively, these dynamics will likely prolong the relatively rapid shifting of species composition for at least one-third to one-half of a century. Such findings suggest that the onset of canopy closure marks the earliest time to glean realistic information about the future species composition of emerging even-aged northern hardwood stands, and that considerable uncertainty remains about what species will eventually dominate the sites.;;;;;;;;;8;0;5;0;8;0742-6348;;BCI:BCI199799334108;

Wood relative density was also related to crown development, as affected by competition. At young ages, the relative densities of entire rings and of the earlywood and latewood zones and the percentages of earlywood within the rings did not differ much among the spacings. As stands grew older, however, ring relative density and earlywood and latewood relative densities increased while the percentage of earlywood decreased. The closer the spacing, the faster relative density increased and the percentage of earlywood decreased. These changes closely followed changes in crown ratio. A good fit was obtained for an equation relating ring relative density to age and percentage of latewood for trees of various ages originating from a wide range of initial spacings. Ring width, ring relative density, and percentage of earlywood were regressed against (1) crown width and distance between the base of the crown and breast height and (2) crown volume and crown ratio. These equations did not fit well at young ages. However, the strength of the relationships improved with age, which indicated the increasing influence of crown development on wood density.;;;;;;;;;16;0;10;0;16;0015-749X;;WOS:A1995TF95000005;

When growth is a process influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors the isolation of true genetic effects may be insurmountable. Realistic simulation studies can illustrate how growth dynamics may distort the genetic parameters and thus caution against naive interpretations of field results. Using a single-tree distance-independent stochastic growth model for stem volume, the influence of additive genetic control of relative growth rate on several growth and yield components (stem density, mean volume, total volume, and mean annual increment) was quantified. Growth results for 2 rotations (150 years), 3 levels of initial spacing, and 4 levels of genetic control are presented. The second rotation consisted of offspring from crop trees at the end of the first generation. Simulation results indicated an upper limit of 20% of the additive genetic contribution to the phenotypic variation in stem-volume. Classic heritability estimates of stem volume became grossly inflated by inter-tree competition. The magnitude of inflation was mirrored by the intensity of the competition process. Nevertheless, a narrow spacing appears more efficient for screening genotypes with a high growth potential than wider spacings. Genetic gains achieved by elimination of trees with slow growth rates (self-thinning) were most pronounced during the juvenile phase of the second generation, and they could only be maintained at low levels of inter-tree competition. Volume and growth gains of about 5% per generation appears realistic when relative growth rates are under a fairly strong genetic control (heritability > 0.3).;;;;;;;;;2;0;2;0;2;0037-5349;;WOS:A1995TL07300009;

Timing of diameter growth during the 1987 growing season was available from an earlier study, and wood formation traits were estimated by X-ray densitometry of increment core samples. Wood formation traits were under weak genetic control (h(i)(2) < 0.20). lengths of earlywood and latewood formation were mostly determined by timing of latewood transition. Overall core density was negatively correlated with the dates of cambial growth initiation (r(A) = -0.41) and latewood transition (r(A) = -0.62), and positively correlated with the date of cambial growth cessation (r(A) = 0.40). As a result of these relationships, higher wood density was associated with a longer duration of cambial growth (r(A) = 0.67) and a slower rate of wood formation (r(A) = -0.37). All density components showed similar relationships with cambial phenology and wood formation traits. Selection for increased wood density is expected to cause only a slight extension of the cambial growth period, but it would also cause an earlier transition to latewood formation, negatively affecting growth rate.;;;;;;;;;18;0;14;0;18;0045-5067;;WOS:A1994QB75000016;

Karst.] grown in Quebec. The objective of the study was to acquire more information on the wood density of Norway spruce grown in plantations and to determine whether the wood density could be used as a selection criterion for species improvement. To this end, 70-year-old commercial plantation-grown trees were first sampled in order to establish the wood density radial variation pattern and determine the existing relationships between the properties of juvenile wood and the average values of mature trees. Subsequently, the study of 22 provenances from central Europe introduced in Quebec was designed to verify the intra- and inter-provenance variation in wood density, determine the correlation between wood density and radial growth rates and origin, and estimate the impact of a selection of superior phenotypes on wood density. The study on 70-year-old trees showed that wood density declines from pith toward bark up to the eighth annual ring, stabilizes until the fourteenth annual ring, and increases thereafter. The simple regression equations calculated between the density of the juvenile wood and the mean density of the trees were significant with R2 Varying from 0.53 to 0.64. The study of the wood density of the trees in the provenance trial, 19 growing seasons after planting, showed the presence of a moderate negative correlation between radial growth rate and wood density. No significant difference was found among provenances with regard to the average density values of the juvenile wood. For the radial variation pattern of wood density and annual growth ring width, comparisons made it possible to identify significant differences between southwestern and northeastern European provenances. There is still, however, strong individual variability in these traits, with 65 to 85% of total variation being due to differences between trees from the same plot. A three-stage selection procedure would make it possible to maintain wood density, to reduce by half the deviation between the internal and external juvenile wood density, and to double the volume output, depending on the selection strategy chosen. These results confirm the potential for rapid growth and the excellent wood quality of Norway spruce provenances that are well adapted to the soil and climate conditions in Quebec.;;;;;;;;;26;0;15;0;28;0735-6161;;WOS:A1994NX63400006;

Hutcheson Memorial Forest Center (HMF) is the New Jersey study site and a logical choice to anchor a review of this topic. HMF contains the longest and largest old field permanent plot study in the USA including extensive data concerning tree invasion and establishment. HMF has also been the site of considerable old field tree experimental research. In addition, I review other investigations of old field tree invasion and establishment of the eastern deciduous biome and contrast them with HMF. I identify critical questions concerning tree invasion and establishment, indicate what progress has been made towards answering these questions and propose future experimentation. I also synthesize results into a conceptual model and investigate the relative importance of seed and seedling processes in determining tree dynamics in old fields.The idea of a possibility or ''window'' for tree invasion and establishment and its variation form the basis for this review. For example, the temporal variation of windows is reflected in tree establishment patterns at HMF because wind- and bird-dispersed species invaded one year after cessation of cultivation while mammal-dispersed species were not present until year 12. Although analysis of size classes of individual HMF trees imply that windows close quickly, studies are of too short duration to tell definitely. Spatial variation in invasion and establishment pattern includes exponential decline in seed and stem density with distance from forest edge which deteriorates with time as the old field becomes more structurally complex. Additional spatial heterogeneity occurs when seeds and seedlings of bird-dispersed species clump which conversely becomes more pronounced with time. Many of these HMF patterns are seen in other eastern United States old field sites.When reviewing field experiments from my site and others, I focus on the spatial and temporal variation and the difference between species in the effect of processes on tree seeds and seedlings. I do this because this variation relates directly to the dynamic nature of windows whose quantification is necessary for modeling. Combining my pattern analysis with a survey of variation in seed and seedling mortality caused by different successional processes in old fields, I conclude that seed dispersal, conditions necessary for seed germination and seed and seedling predation are the critical processes controlling and constraining tree invasion and establishment in old fields. Competition and indirect effects of litter and the environment, which modify how these processes affect tree dynamics, are also important. Therefore, processes involving the interaction of species with the environment and with other species form the principal filters on and limitations to tree invasion and establishment and not the non-interactive life-history traits of individual tree species such as growth rate or longevity. The interaction of pattern and process and the affect of many of these processes on old field community structure are also discussed.;;;;;;;;;80;2;81;1;91;juin-01;;WOS:A1993MG55200001;

A 0.6 ha plot encompassing the entire 1962 plot area was surveyed, mapped, and permanently marked in 1992. The diameter (dbh) and species of all live and dead tree stems gt 1.37 m tell were recorded in 10 0.04 ha contiguous plots in 1962, and in 60 0.01 ha contiguous subplots in 1992. Changes in the original 0.4 ha plot area over the 30-yr period are summarized here. The basal area of standing dead trees decreased from 15.7 to 3.5 m-2/ha. Castanea dentata accounted for 29% of the original, and 0% of the recent standing dead basal area. Live tree basal area and biomass increased from 47.3 to 57.7 m-2/ha, and 386 to 459 Mg/ha, respectively. Total stem density decreased from 642 to 563 stems/ha. Size-class distributions exhibited a gradual, log-linear decrease in stem density with increasing size at both sampling dates. No marked changes in species composition of the tree stratum were observed; Acer rubrum and Tsuga canadensis dominated at both sampling dates. Species-specific, radial growth rate means ranged from 0.7 to 2.2 mm/yr. Mortality rates for all canopy trees gt 30 cm dbh were in the 0.5 to 1.5%/yr range.

In this study, sample material from crosses of Eucalyptus grandis with E. tereticornis, E. camaldulensis and E. urophylla established on sites of which some are not normally suitable for E. grandis, was examined. The main aim was to assess the performance of these hybrids under varying site conditions using E. grandis as a control. At the age of five years samples were taken from six sites. One was established in the eastern Cape (near Stutterheim), two on the eastern Transvaal highveld (near Amsterdam and Jessievale), two in the northeastern Transvaal (near Tzaneen and Soekmekaar) and one in Zululand. Two trees of the best performing clones (judged over all six sites) from each hybrid were taken at random at each site, with two trees of an E. grandis clone to serve as a control. Aspects examined included split development and behaviour due to growth stresses, differences and variation patterns in density, collapse, fibre length, vessel properties, sapwood width, split and check development during drying in the round, and preservative penetration and retention characteristics. On average, trees from good sites tended to produce wood of higher density than those from ""slow-growing"" sites, but no direct relationship between growth rate and wood density was found. Hybrids produced wood of higher density than E. grandis, with a more or less intermediate density between those of the species used in the crosses. Wood density had a strong adverse effect on all preservation characteristics. No effect of site on splitting due to growth stresses could be found but growth stress splitting varied significantly among hybrids. E. grandis times E. urophylla developed less end-splitting than the other two hybrids and E. grandis. This study indicated marked differences among sites in growth rate and some wood properties and qualities. Inter-site differences in wood properties may be due to genotype/environmental effects since in many cases these differences could not be accounted for by differences in the growth rate.";;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;0038-2167;;BCI:BCI199497358340;

Clones, trees, and heights have a highly significant effect on wood density, and the individual-tree broad-sense heritability is 0.64. The wood density of this hybrid tends to be high at the bottom of the tree, decreases to a minimum at mid-height, then increases again near the top of the merchantable stem. There is also a highly significant correlation between the weighted average wood density of the merchantable stem and the wood density of the increment core taken at breast height.

Samples were also collected from control trees, representing a ""felling select"" seedlot, within the same progeny trial. Properties examined included growth rate, wood density, and resin content (all by five-ring core segments), heartwood percentage and compression wood rating (whole cores), and tracheid length (outerwood only). Although wood density was variable (coefficient of variation about 0.07), the average for the progenies overall was almost identical to that of the control trees. On the other hand, there were slight indications that, along with the improved growth rate of the progenies, compression wood and heartwood resin content levels increased whereas tracheid length decreased. Heritability estimates for all the actual wood properties were high, ranging from 0.4 upwards, and coefficients of variation for resin content variables and heartwood content were very high (0.4 or higher), suggesting good prospects for genetic manipulation.";;;;;;;;;40;0;36;1;46;0048-0134;;BCI:BCI199396098773;

Previously published life-table analyses, which used only 2 years of field data (1975-77), were compared with life-table analysis based on a further 5 years of field data for growth and survival (1977-82). The new analysis calculated the finite rate of natural increase, lambda, as 1.009 +/- 0.077. This value is closer to the theoretical value of 1.0 for a stable population than is the value calculated on the basis of only 2 years of field data (1.021 +/- 0.093). However, the two estimates are not significantly different from each other or from a value of 1.0.Despite the similarity of estimates for lambda, the life-table analysis based on 5 years of data showed some marked differences from the earlier analysis. Revised growth and survival rates imply a slower progression to reproductive maturity and shorter reproductive life for A. cunninghamii. The predicted stable stage distribution (SSD) showed a better fit to the initial stage distribution (ISD), and bulges in the frequency distribution for large trees can be explained by the varying rates at which individuals grow from one stage to the next.The relative contributions of survival, growth and fecundity to the observed population growth rate (elasticity) remained similar for both analyses. Survival rate contributes most significantly to the achieved population growth rate, and this appears typical of long-lived plant species. However, the pattern of elasticities across size-classes changed for the new analysis and identified different critical life history stages from those recorded previously.Elasticity is proposed as a measure for classifying species using the competitive (C), stress-tolerant (S) and ruderal (R) model of plant strategies.;;;;;;;;;24;0;23;0;24;0307-692X;;WOS:A1991GU20900009;

Such information is important because of the fact that a large proportion of this species is grown under intensive short-rotation management for the production of mining timber and pulpwood. In this study the intercorrelation between wood properties, the variation among families and the effect of growth rate on these properties were studed in 216 young trees sampled from a full-sib diallel progeny trial consisting of 72 families established in the Eastern Transvaal by the Department of Environment Affairs. Results of a factor analysis indicated that the variations in the basic wood properties of young E. grandis is adequately described by studying wood density, fibre lengths and vessel properties such as size, frequency and fractional volume. All these properties vary significantly among families suggesting some genetic influence. Heritability estimates obtained for density, fibre length and vessel diameter are more or less similar in magnitude to those found in previous studies. This, as a number of other studies, indicated no significant or practically important phenotypic correlation between growth rate and wood properties. On the other hand, significant negative genetic correlations of rate of growth with wood density and fibre length were found, although the esimates obtained were considerably less than previously calculated.;;;;;;;;;1;0;0;1;1;0038-2167;;BCI:BCI199293099099;

The death of terminal shoots and the occurrence of new leaders were frequently observed in almost all species. The sharp decrease in the annual height growth and the increase in the death rate occurred in 1980 or 1981 in many species in parallel, which was attributed to the unusual drought in the summer of 1980. An introduced pioneer species, Pinus lutchuensis, has been invading the forest which is thought to be in the stable climax stage of succession. The height growth rate of the pine juveniles, 19.9 cm/year, was much higher than any other native component species.

The root, bole and crown zones of such gaps provide very different conditions of nutrient input and root competition and, therefore, should favor trees with different early growth forms and nutrient requirements. The role of gaps in the maintenance of tree species richness is explored by outlining the major differences among the three zones of a single tree-fall gap, demonstrating the high rates of invasions of these gaps by tree seedlings, and predicting the phenotypic traits of seeds and seedlings that should best adapt them to conditions in the different zones. Traits examined include seed size, allocation of cotyledonary reserves, shade tolerance, vertical growth rate, wood density (mechanical strength), armament, branching, leaf layering, leaf orientation, leaf construction and longevity, petioles and mycorrhizal associations. The potential roles of gap size, season of formation, and species of tree that formed the gap are also considered. Tree falls in the temperate zone probably do not have the same effect on tree species richness because of the conditions of tree fall (trunk snapping, falling in winter when no leaves are present), the greater nutrient reserves in temperate forest soils, and the importance of windstorms and fire in temperate forests.;;;;;;;;;105;3;99;3;112;0564-3295;;BCI:BCI198477017955;

Branch size is the most important factor influencing timber stiffness and strength, and density is the next most important. Together they accounted for about 80% of the variation that occurred in timber stiffness as revealed by machine stress-grading. The most satisfactory multiple regression equation linking modulus of elasticity of 100 .times. 50 mm timber loaded as a plank (Ep) with branch size and wood density was Ep (gigapascals) = 2.9014-0.07048 branch index (mm) + 0.01269 density (kg/m3) where Ep is the mean Ep of all pieces cut from a log, density is the mean density of these pieces and branch index is that of the log concerned. Branch index was determined by measuring the largest branch per quartile per 1.2 m length and averaging the 16 measurements per log thus obtained. The radial growth rate had only a small effect on density in wood of the same cambial age, particularly in wood more than 12 growth rings from the pith. With machine stress-grading, much larger knot sizes can be tolerated than with visual grading with current rules, particularly when wood density is high. Only if the sawn output is machine graded, can further planting of Douglas fir for production of timber for engineering and framing uses possibly be justified. The objective in management of Douglas fir in New Zealand should be to grow trees as rapidly as possible and on as short a rotation as possible consistent with keeping branch index in the bottom 2 4.8 m log lengths down to 36 mm, assuming that mean wood density will be .apprx. 400 kg/m3. If this is achieved, at least 60% of the sawn timber volume produced from the bottom 2 logs should quality for exacting engineering uses with machine stress-grading. This is far superior to what can be achieved with radiata pine grown on current silvicultural schedules. A silvicultural regime which should maintain branch size in the bottom 2 logs within the required limits is given. It involves a relatively wide initial spacing, heavy early thinning, and a short rotation age and is radically different from regimes currently practiced. No attempt is made to provide an economic justification for this regime.;;;;;;;;;8;1;6;0;9;0028-8284;;BCI:BCI197865026703;

Prevalence of heart stain was not-related to site quality, geographical location, or stand type (old-versus 2nd-growth) when trees of similar diameter were compared. The occurrence of heart stain was greater among large, old trees that had grown slowly. Heart stain prevalence was independent of crown class, ratio of live crown, and origin of tree (seed versus sprout). There was no evidence of a genetic effect on occurrence of heart stain. Among trees with heart stain, only rate of radial growth and ratio of live crown were significantly associated with variation in extent of heart stain in tanoak. The relationship between these tree characteristics and percentage of diameter stained was weak, but the extent of heart stain tended to increase with decreasing rate of radial growth and ratio of live crown. Prediction of extent of heart stain by multiple linear regression was not sufficiently strong to be of practical importance. Variation in age, diameter, rate of radial growth, and site index were generally associated with changes in specific gravity in tanoak. There was also evidence of interaction between these variables relative to their apparent effect on wood density. Prediction of tanoak, specific gravity using diameter, age, height, rate of radial growth, rate of height growth, and ratio of live crown as predictor variables was weak and inconsistent when multiple linear regression was applied within sites. Based on a limited sample of tanoak sprout clumps mere was some evidence of a genetic influence on wood specific gravity in tanoak. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author;;;;;;;;;0;0;1;0;1;;;BCI:BCI19684900004838;

Specific gravity of heartwood was slightly higher than that of sapwood, and both decreased among dominant and codominant trees with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH), and increased with age and tree height. Thus specific gravity of trees as estimated from increment cores may be determined more accurately by also considering the correlation to DBH and tree height. Wood density was also related to the percentage of summerwood, but seldom to growth rate. The growth rate of a number of suppressed and intermediate trees correlated with fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. Differences among tree classes and soils were reflected in the amount of summer-wood produced. Stronger, i.e. generally older, trees contained a greater percentage of heartwood. The shrinkage of heartwood tended to be lower than that of sapwood. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors;;;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;;;BCI:BCI19684900053453;
WD;J;THOR, E.;;;;;;;;Variation in some wood properties of eastern white pine;;;;;;;;FOREST SCI;;;;11;-4;;;451;455;;;;;1965;1965;"Variation in growth rate and wood properties were studied from breast-height increment cores from 31 selected P. strobus L. trees growing in Morgan County, Tenn. The average amount of extractives was equal to 8.4 percent of the unextracted young wood (10-20 yrs. from the pith) and 7.2 percent of the older wood (20-30 yrs. from the pith). Older wood had longer tracheids and higher specific gravities than young wood. Variation among trees was significant at the 0.1 percent level for all characteristics except two: specific gravities of extracted and unextracted young wood. The correlation coefficients for radial growth and extracted specific gravities accounted for 11.5 percent of the variation in specific gravity of young wood; 9.5 percent for old wood. Relationships between radial growth and extractives, and tracheid length were weak, being significant only in young wood. Thus, growth differences did not account for a large proportion of the variation in these wood properties. Relationships such as those between specific gravity before and after extraction, between tracheid length at 20 and 30 years, and between extracted specific gravity of young and old wood, accounted for large proportions of the variations. Extractives accounted for only about 17 percent of the variation in young wood density, but 44 percent in the density of old wood. The relationship between specific gravity and tracheid length was very weak. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author";;;;;;;;;6;0;4;0;6;;;BCI:BCI19664700044487;
WD;J;THOR, EYVIND;;;;;;;;Variation in Virginia pine. I: Natural variation in wood properties;;;;;;;;JOUR FOREST;;;;62;-4;;;258;262;;;;;1964;1964;Fifteen trees in each of 13 stands in Kentucky and Tennessee were used in a study to determine variation in wood specific gravity, extractives, and tracheid lengths. Differences among stands in specific gravity were largely due to differences in amounts of extractives, and there were no significant differences among stands for extracted sp. gr. of the wood. Trees with high specific gravity and a high extractive content were found to have extracted specific gravities close to the normal for the species. An apparent clinal variation pattern in tracheid length was observed on the Cumberland Plateau and Mountains. Stands further north had longer average tracheids than those toward the south. For all characteristics a large proportion of the total variation is accounted for by the among-tree variance component. This component was especially large for specific gravity of extracted wood (68 percent). No significant relationshep exists between radial growth and specific gravity before extraction. After extraction there is a significant correlation, where radial growth accounts for almost 7 percent of the among-tree variation in specific gravity. Rapid growth rate is associated with larger amounts of extractives in the trees, but does not appear to cause a serious reduction in tracheid length. There is no significant correlation between specific gravity and tracheid length. The effect of ex tractives in the pulping process is discussed and it is suggested that extractives be incorporated as a factor in a selection program for Virginia pine. Trees with rapid growth rate, low extractives, and high specific gravity are not too difficult to find. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author;;;;;;;;;14;0;11;0;14;;;BCI:BCI19644500075341;
WD;J;"HARRIS, J. M.; ORMAN, H. R.";;;;;;;;The physical and mechanical properties of New Zealand-grown Douglas-fir;;;;;;;;TECH PAPER FOREST RES INST NEW ZEALAND FOREST SERV;;;;24;;;;1;87;;;;;1958;1958;Tests of 24 trees of Pseudotsuga taxifolia from 11 contrasting sites indicated that wood density (when air dry, 24-35 lb./cu. ft.) depends mostly upon age of tree and rate of growth, accompanied by a change in percentage and density of latewood. The growth rate recommended for New Zealand, to achieve desired average basic specific gravity of 0.42, is 8 rings per inch at breast height after 15 years age. This can be achieved best by planting at 6 x 6 ft. distance and thinning appropriately. Any Douglas-fir with fewer than 5 rings per inch should be excluded from superior grades of structural timber. Tests of 12 trees and 30 flitches from 4 sites indicated that New Zealand plantation-grown Douglas-fir is as dense and strong as virgin and second-growth material grown on the west coast of N. America. Values for mechanical properties tended to decrease at increasing height above ground and to increase at increasing distance from the pith. Examination for low density or low strength is recommended for any Douglas-fir grown in areas with less than 30 in. annual rainfall. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: F. W.

WD;J;STILLINGER, J. R.;;;;;;;;Strength and related properties of second-growth Port Orford white-cedar;;;;;;;;JOUR FOREST;;;;51;-8;;;555;559;;;;;1953;1953;Tests were made on green and dry material in 3 growth-rate classes: fast (8 or less rings per in.), avg. (9-16 rings), and slow (over 16 rings). Some properties of the second-growth wood were higher than for old-growth wood of the same specific gravity, some were lower, and others showed no difference. The fast-growing second-growth wood was significantly lower in specific gravity than the slow and average second-growth and old-growth wood. Specific gravity decreased from pith to the bark and from the base to the top of the tree. The tests indicated that second-growth wood should enjoy the same use outlets as old-growth wood. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: J. R. Stillinger;;;;;;;;;1;0;1;0;2;;;BCI:BCI19542800004349;

WD;J;JOHNSON, L. P. V.;;;;;;;;Studies on the relation of growth rate to wood quality in Populus hybrids;;;;;;;;CANADIAN JOUR RES SECT C BOT SCI;;;;20;-1;;;28;40;;;;;1942;1942;Expts. were conducted on the relation of growth rate to wood quality in a series of 43 hybrid and parental trees, which involved Populus alba, P. grandi-dentata, and P. tremuloides. Fibers in fast growth annual rings were longer on the average than those in slow growth rings from the same tree. In single annual rings, fibers of early wood were shorter and thicker than those of late wood. Av. fiber diam. of individual trees was significantly correlated in a positive manner with growth rate, but the correlation between fiber length and growth rate was well below the level of significance. Short, thick habit of growth was significantly correlated with high density of wood, but correlations between growth rate (in terms of annual increment in volume) and wood density were insignificant. Exptl. pulp and paper tests did not reveal any very striking differences in quality between fast growing hybrid and slow growing parental trees, although there remains some doubt as to the suitability of abnormally fast growth hybrid wood for some of the higher grades of soda pulp paper. Rapid growth does not seem seriously detrimental to wood quality. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. abst;;;;;;;;;14;0;12;0;14;;;BCI:BCI19421600010764;
