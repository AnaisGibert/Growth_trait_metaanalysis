abstract = {Competition is believed to be a central force limiting local diversity and controlling the structure of plant communities. However, it has been proposed that the stressed understory environment limits total understory plant density to such low levels that competitive exclusion cannot be an important factor limiting the local diversity of understory plants. To evaluate the importance of inter-seedling competition, we performed a seedling competition experiment with five shade-tolerant species in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Three-month-old seedlings were transplanted into the forest singly or with their roots intertwined with a single conspecific or heterospecific seedling in all pairwise species combinations. If competition is important, performance (survival, stem height, and number of leaves after one and six years) would be expected to be lowest with a conspecific neighbor and greatest without a neighbor. The experiment was replicated in five 0.24-m(2) plots at each of 20 sites in tall secondary forest. To test whether seedling performance differed among treatments we fitted linear mixed models (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), treating species identity and microsite (site and plot) as random effects. The five shade-tolerant study species all experienced good establishment with relatively high survival and growth rates. The neighbor treatment consistently affected seedling performance, but the effect was always very small, both in absolute terms and relative to the much stronger species and microsite effects. Seedlings with a conspecific neighbor consistently performed worse than seedlings with a heterospecific neighbor, but having no neighbor generally did not cause superior performance relative to the other treatments. We conclude that direct competitive interactions are relatively unimportant among understory plants in humid tropical forests.},

abstract = {Biochemical models of photosynthesis suggest that rising temperatures will increase rates of net carbon dioxide assimilation and enhance plant responses to increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating acclimation and ontogenetic drift in net photosynthesis in seedlings of five boreal tree species grown at 370 and 580 {micro}mol mol-1 CO2 in combination with day/night temperatures of 18/12, 21/15, 24/18, 27/21, and 30/24 {degrees}C. Leaf-area-based rates of net photosynthesis increased between 13 and 36% among species in plants grown and measured in elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2. These CO2-induced increases in net photosynthesis were greater for slower-growing Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P., Pinus banksiana Lamb., and Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch than for faster-growing Populus tremuloides Michx. and Betula papyrifera Marsh., paralleling longer-term growth differences between CO2 treatments. Measures at common CO2 concentrations revealed that net photosynthesis was down-regulated in plants grown at elevated CO2. In situ leaf gas exchange rates varied minimally across temperature treatments and, contrary to predictions, increasing growth temperatures did not enhance the response of net photosynthesis to elevated CO2 in four of the five species. Overall, the species exhibited declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration, and increases in total nonstructural carbohydrates in response to CO2 enrichment. Consequently, the elevated CO2 treatment enhanced rates of net photosynthesis much more when expressed on a leaf area basis (25%) than when expressed on a leaf mass basis (10%). In all species, rates of leaf net CO2 exchange exhibited modest declines with increasing plant size through ontogeny. Among the conifers, enhancements of photosynthetic rates in elevated CO2 were sustained through time across a wide range of plant sizes. In contrast, for Populus tremuloides and B. papyrifera, mass-based photosynthetic rates did not differ between CO2 treatments. Overall, net photosynthetic rates were highly correlated with relative growth rate as it varied among species and treatment combinations through time. We conclude that interspecific variation may be a more important determinant of photosynthetic response to CO2 than temperature.},

abstract = {Water availability is one of the key environmental factors that affect plant establishment and distribution. In many regions water availability will decline with climate change, exposing small seedlings to a greater likelihood of drought. In this study, 17 leaves, stem, root, and whole-plant traits of ten woody Mediterranean species were measured under favourable growing conditions and seedling drought survival was evaluated during a simulated dry-down episode. The aims of this study were: i) to assess drought survival of different species, ii) to analyse which functional traits predict drought survival time, and iii) to explain species distribution in the field, based on species drought survival and drought strategies. Drought survival time varied ten-fold across species, from 19 to 192 days. Across species, drought survival was positively related to the rooting depth per leaf area, i.e., the ability to acquire water from deeper soil layers while reducing transpiring leaf area. Drought survival time was negatively related to species ability to grow quickly, as indicated by high relative growth and net assimilation rates. Drought survival also explained species distribution in the field. It was found that species were sorted along a continuum, ranging between two contrasting species functional extremes based on functional traits and drought performance. One extreme consisted of acquisitive fast-growing deciduous species, with thin, soft metabolically active leaves, with high resource use and vulnerability to drought. The opposite extreme consisted of conservative slow-growing evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, deep roots, a low transpiring area, and low water use, resulting in high drought survival and drought tolerance. The results show that these drought strategies shape species distribution in this Mediterranean area.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A trade-off between shade tolerance and growth in high light is thought to underlie the temporal dynamics of humid forests. On the other hand, it has been suggested that tree species sorting on temperature gradients involves a trade-off between growth rate and cold resistance. Little is known about how these two major trade-offs interact. METHODS: Seedlings of Australian tropical and cool-temperate rainforest trees were grown in glasshouse environments to compare growth versus shade-tolerance trade-offs in these two assemblages. Biomass distribution, photosynthetic capacity and vessel diameters were measured in order to examine the functional correlates of species differences in light requirements and growth rate. Species light requirements were assessed by field estimation of the light compensation point for stem growth. RESULTS: Light-demanding and shade-tolerant tropical species differed markedly in relative growth rates (RGR), but this trend was less evident among temperate species. This pattern was paralleled by biomass distribution data: specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) of tropical species were significantly positively correlated with compensation points, but not those of cool-temperate species. The relatively slow growth and small SLA and LAR of Tasmanian light-demanders were associated with narrow vessels and low potential sapwood conductivity. CONCLUSIONS: The conservative xylem traits, small LAR and modest RGR of Tasmanian light-demanders are consistent with selection for resistance to freeze-thaw embolism, at the expense of growth rate. Whereas competition for light favours rapid growth in light-demanding trees native to environments with warm, frost-free growing seasons, frost resistance may be an equally important determinant of the fitness of light-demanders in cool-temperate rainforest, as seedlings establishing in large openings are exposed to sub-zero temperatures that can occur throughout most of the year.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown plant species' dispersal distances to be strongly related to life-history traits, but how well different traits can predict dispersal distances is not yet known. We used cross-validation techniques and a global data set (576 plant species) to measure the predictive power of simple plant traits to estimate species' maximum dispersal distances. Including dispersal syndrome (wind, animal, ant, ballistic, and no special syndrome), growth form (tree, shrub, herb), seed mass, seed release height, and terminal velocity in different combinations as explanatory variables we constructed models to explain variation in measured maximum dispersal distances and evaluated their power to predict maximum dispersal distances. Predictions are more accurate, but also limited to a particular set of species, if data on more specific traits, such as terminal velocity, are available. The best model (R2 = 0.60) included dispersal syndrome, growth form, and terminal velocity as fixed effects. Reasonable predictions of maximum dispersal distance (R2 = 0.53) are also possible when using only the simplest and most commonly measured traits; dispersal syndrome and growth form together with species taxonomy data. We provide a function (dispeRsal) to be run in the software package R. This enables researchers to estimate maximum dispersal distances with confidence intervals for plant species using measured traits as predictors. Easily obtainable trait data, such as dispersal syndrome (inferred from seed morphology) and growth form, enable predictions to be made for a large number of species.},

abstract = {A dominant hypothesis explaining tree species coexistence in tropical forest is that trade-offs in characters allow species to adapt to different light environments, but tests for this hypothesis are scarce. This study is the first that uses a theoretical plant growth model to link leaf trade-offs to whole-plant performances and to differential performances across species in different light environments. Using data of 50 sympatric tree species from a Bolivian rain forest, we observed that specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity codetermined interspecific height growth variation in a forest gap; that leaf survival rate determined the variation in plant survival rate under a closed canopy; that predicted height growth and plant survival rate matched field observations; and that fast-growing species had low survival rates for both field and predicted values. These results show how leaf trade-offs influence differential tree performance and tree species' coexistence in a heterogeneous light environment.},

abstract = {Why do inherently fast-growing species from productive habitats generally have a higher rate of biomass production in short-term low-nitrogen experiments than slow-growing species from unproductive habitats, whereas the opposite is found in long-term experiments? Is this mainly due to inherent differences in biomass allocation, leaf characteristics or the plants' physiology? To analyse these questions we grew five monocotyledonous species from productive and unproductive habitats in a climate chamber at both high and low nitrogen supply. Nitrate was supplied exponentially, enabling us to compare inherent differences in morphological and physiological traits between the species, without any interference due to differences in the species' ability to take up nutrients. At high nitrogen supply, we found major inherent differences in specific leaf area and nitrogen productivity, i.e. daily biomass increment per unit plant nitrogen, whereas there were only small differences in net assimilation rate, i.e. daily biomass increment per unit leaf area, and biomass partitioning. We propose that the higher specific leaf area and nitrogen productivity of inherently fast-growing species are the key factors explaining their high abundance in productive habitats compared with inherently slow-growing ones. At low nitrogen supply, the net assimilation rate was decreased to a similar extent for all species, compared with that at high nitrogen supply. The nitrogen productivity of the inherently fast-growing species decreased with decreasing nitrogen supply, whereas that of the inherently slow-growing species remained constant. There were no inherent differences in nitrogen productivity in this treatment. At this low nitrogen supply, the inherently fast-growing species invested relatively more biomass in their roots than the slow-growing ones did. The inherently fast-growing species still had a higher specific leaf area at low nitrogen supply, but the difference between species was less than that at high nitrogen supply. Based on the present results and our optimization model for carbon and nitrogen allocation (Van der Werf et al. 1993a), we propose that the relatively large investment in root biomass of fast-growing species is the key factor explaining their higher biomass production in short-term experiments. We also propose that in the long run the competitive ability of the slow-growing species will increase due to a lower turnover rate of biomass. It is concluded that the plant's physiology (net assimilation rate and nitrogen productivity), only plays a minor role in the species' competitive ability in low-nitrogen environments.},

abstract = {The growth and physiological characteristics of canopy trees are expected to differ systematically from those of understory trees on the basis of size-dependent aspects of biomechanics, resource availability, and life history Although such differences have previously been noted, there has been relatively little effort to quantify these in terms of interspecific allometric relationships. Asymptotic maximal height (Hmax) is advocated as a measure of the size of dicotyledonous woody plants for this purpose Height diameter (H-D) relationships in 38 species within six genera of Malaysian rain forest trees are well described by an asymptotic model, and thus provide a basis for estimating Hmax using static observational data Three important aspects of tree growth strategies are shown to be predictable on the basis of these values: average tree growth rates are positively related to Hmax, while wood density and the initial allometric slope of (species-specific) H-D relationships are negatively related to Hmax. These patterns may be explained by an association of low light levels with slow growth and high density wood in understory species; the latter property may in turn allow for relatively high allometric slopes of H-D relationships in saplings of small-statured species Analyses that control for phylogenetic differences provide evidence that such interspecific allometric patterns are the product of convergent evolution These results are consistent with the idea that much ecological variation within species-rich taxa of southeast Asian rain forest trees is related to differentiation along a vertical axis of tree size},

Relative growth rate (RGR) was high in Group II, moderate in Group I and low in Group III. The regression coefficient for the relationship between RGR and leaf nitrogen concentration was higher in Group II than in Group I, and no relationship was observed in Group III. Parameter analysis of RGR indicated that RGR per unit leaf nitrogen was important for all three groups, but that the allocation of nitrogen to leaves was particularly important in Groups I and II. The ratio of dark respiratory rate (R) to net photosynthetic rate (A) was higher in Group I than in Group II. Neither A nor R was measured in the Group III species. A linear relationship was observed between leaf nitrogen concentration and A in Group II, but this relationship was not evident in Group I.},

abstract = {We compared growth, photosynthetic performance and shade adaptation of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) plants growing in natural shade (33, 55 and 77% reduction in incoming radiation) to control plants growing in full sunlight. Stem diameter and plant height, measured over a 15-month period, were greatest in plants grown in full sunlight, and both parameters decreased with increasing shade. At 7 and 14 months after planting (MAP), total plant dry mass was highest in control plants and lowest in plants in 77% shade. Expansion of the fourth leaf whorl, monitored at 5-6 MAP, was slowest in plants in 77% shade and fastest in unshaded plants, which had more leaves and higher leaf areas and inter-whorl shoot lengths. In response to increasing shade, specific leaf area increased, whereas leaf weight ratio and relative growth rate decreased. Chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased with increasing shade, indicating shade-induced partitioning of chlorophyll into light-harvesting complexes. Compared to the response in unshaded plants, CO2 assimilation saturated at lower photosynthetic photon flux densities in plants in 77% shade, with a lower upper-asymptote to the light response curve. Chlorophyll fluorescence revealed no evidence of sustained photoinhibitory damage in unshaded plants. Dynamic photoinhibition decreased with increasing shade, with the greatest depression in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence around midday. We conclude that shade adaptation and shade-induced reductions in dynamic photoinhibition account for the enhanced early growth of rubber in light shade.},

abstract = {A 2-yr field experiment was used to determine the response of riparian plants to accumulation of litter or silt in a river flood-plain meadow in northern Sweden. Such disturbances occur regularly in free-flowing rivers but are likely to change as a result of global changes in land use or climate. We anticipated that plants with different traits would differ in their response to litter and silt accumulation. We quantified plant response as relative change in above-ground biomass, and regressed it on either litter mass or silt depth, and on plant traits such as lateral spread, plant height, relative growth rate, seed mass and seed persistence in soil. The relative changes in riparian plant biomass following litter or silt accumulation were negatively related to litter mass and silt depth, and positively related to most examined plant traits such as seed mass, seed persistence and lateral spread. The vegetation recovery in the second season was largely determined by plant traits; litter or silt accumulation had no significant effect. Litter accumulation selected for large-seeded species, but silt accumulation selected for species with strong ability of lateral spread. Seed persistence was a useful variable in predicting species recovery from both litter and silt accumulation. Plant height was negatively related to plant recovery, but relative growth rate was not significantly related to relative change in plant biomass after silt or litter accumulation. Our results imply that plant traits are important variables to consider for predicting the responses of riparian vegetation to deposition of organic and inorganic matter.},

abstract = {The regeneration niche has been little investigated in studies of community assembly and plant distribution. We examined adaptive associations between seedling traits and habitat specialization. Two habitat contrasts were investigated across several evolutionary lineages of angiosperms: species specialized to forest vs. open habitats and to dry vs. wet habitats. We also tested whether effects of shade and drought vary independently or, alternatively, if shade may amplify effects on drought-stressed plants. Seedling response in terms of growth rate, height, slenderness, specific leaf area (SLA) and degree of elongation (longest internode; petiole or leaf-sheath depending on species' morphology) to light and watering treatments was assessed. We used a factorial design involving three light regimes and two watering frequencies. The open-shaded habitat contrast and the dry-wet habitat contrast were investigated using six and five pairs of congeneric species, respectively. The congeneric species pair design controlled for confounding effects of evolutionary history prior to divergence in habitat specialization. Seedling growth rate generally decreased with shade and reduced watering frequency. Plant height was generally largest at intermediate light. Specialization to shaded habitats was associated with a more conservative growth strategy, i.e. showing a more modest growth response to increasing light. Species from all habitats showed the highest relative elongation at intermediate light, except for the moist-habitat species, for which elongation increased with shade. Contrary to our expectations, species from dry habitats grew bigger than species from moist habitats in all treatments. SLA responded to the light treatment, but not to watering regime. The contrasting light and moisture conditions across habitats appear to not have selected for differences in SLA. We conclude that seedling phase strategies of resource allocation in temperate herbs contribute to their habitat specialization. Habitat-specific seedling strategies and trade-offs in response to resource availability and environmental conditions may be important to adaptive specialization.},

abstract = {The adaptation of plant species to their biotic and abiotic environment is manifested in their traits. Suites of correlated functional traits may reflect fundamental tradeoffs and general plant strategies and hence represent trait spectra along which plant species can vary according to their respective strategies. However, the functional interpretation of these trait spectra requires the inspection of their relation to plant performance. We employed principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) to quantify fundamental whole-plant trait spectra based on 23 traits for 305 North American woody species that span boreal to subtropical climates. We related the major axes of PCoA to five measures of plant performance (i.e., growth rate, and tolerance to drought, shade, water-logging and fire) for all species and separately for gymnosperms and angiosperms. Across all species a unified gymnosperm-angiosperm trait spectrum (wood density, seed mass, rooting habit) is identified, which is correlated with drought tolerance. Apart from this, leaf type and specific leaf area (SLA) strongly separate gymnosperms from angiosperms. For gymnosperms, one trait spectrum emerges (seed mass, rooting habit), which is positively correlated with drought tolerance and inversely with shade tolerance, reflecting a tradeoff between these two strategies due to opposing trait characteristics. Angiosperms are functionally more diverse. The trait spectra related to drought tolerance and shade tolerance are decoupled and three distinct strategies emerge: high drought tolerance (low SLA, dense wood, heavy seeds, taproot), high shade tolerance (high SLA, shallow roots, high toxicity, opposite arranged leaves), and fast growth/stress intolerance (large maximum heights, soft wood, light seeds, high seed spread rate). In summary, our approach reveals that complex suits of traits and potential tradeoffs underlie fundamental performance strategies in forests. Studies relying on small sets of plant traits may not be able to reveal such underlying strategies.},

abstract = {Intraspecific and interspecific architectural patterns were studied for eight tree species of a Bornean rain forest. Trees 5-19 m tall in two 4-ha permanent sample plots in primary forest were selected, and three light descriptors and seven architectural traits for each tree were measured. Two general predictions were made: (1) Slow growing individuals (or short ones) encounter lower light, and have flatter crowns, fewer leaf layers, and thinner stems, than do fast growing individuals (or tall ones). (2) Species with higher shade-tolerance receive less light and have flatter crowns, fewer leaf layers, and thinner stems, than do species with lower shade-tolerance. Shade-tolerance is assumed to decrease with maximum growth rate, mortality rate, and adult sature of a species. Two light descriptors (crown position index and available space, but not canopy height) indicated higher light conditions for trees with more rapid growth, and for trees of greater height. Light levels were higher for species with high maximum growth rates and with greater adult stature. Most intraspecific architectural patterns conformed to the predictions: total leaf area and the number of leaf layers increased with increasing height and higher growth rates, and crown length/tree height ratio and stem slenderness respectively increased and decreased with growth rate. Yet, crown width/tree height ratio and relative crown length did not change with tree height, nor did they with previous growth. Slow growing (and short) trees may not have the reserves to invest in further horizontal crown growth, and to avoid leaf self-shading sufficiently within their relatively narrow crowns. Predictions on interspecific architectural patterns were not supported by the data. Species that were expected to be more shade-tolerant (lower maximum growth, lower mortality, and shorter stature) had deeper crowns, greater leaf areas, and more leaf layers, than did less shade-tolerant species. These patterns may be explained by lower loss rates of branches and leaves of the more shade-tolerant species. These species avoid leaf self-shading by distributing their leaves at the crown periphery. The role of lateral light appears to be more important than hitherto realized. The crown width/height ratio and height/dbh ratio were negatively correlated, both intraspecifically and interspecifically. It is suggested that trees co-ordinate their crown and stem growth so that they maintain their stability at small safety margins in the forest understorey., Tropical Forest Canopies: Ecology and Management.

abstract = {1. It has been reported that species from environments where seedlings are prone to drought during establishment tend to have larger seeds. One proposed reason for this is that larger-seeded species might be able to allocate a larger proportion of mass to roots rather than shoots during early growth. 2. Seedlings of 32 species from arid central Australia were grown in coarse sand under standard conditions in a glasshouse, and harvested 10 days after germination. Seedlings from heavier-seeded species did not allocate relatively more resources to roots than lighter-seeded species. Complementary experiments confirmed this result for plants grown on sandy loam, in drying as compared to well-watered soil, and under shaded conditions. 3. Seedlings of heavier-seeded species tended to survive longer than seedlings from lighter-seeded species when grown in the absence of any mineral nutrients other than those in the seed. 4. Seedlings of heavier-seeded species tended to be able to emerge from greater depths in the soil than lighter-seeded species. 5. Seedlings from heavier-seeded species had a slower relative growth rate than lighter-seeded species during the first 10 days after germination. Nevertheless, among these species, seed size was more important than relative growth rate or germination speed in determining seedling size 10 days after seeds were wetted.},

abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

At 100 $\mu$M NO3 -, the relative growth rate (RGR) of the perennial was 30% lower than that of the annual. This was only the consequence of the higher specific mass of its leaves, since its leaf mass ration was higher than that of the annual and the unit leaf rates (ULR), calculated on an area basis, were similar for the two species. At 1 $\mu$M, the RGR of the annual was 50% lower than at 100 $\mu$M, while that of the perennial was not significantly lower. This was due mainly to a lower ULR for the annual. while for the perennial ULR was the same in both treatments. These differences between the two species were all the more striking in that the differences in total nitrogen concentrations and nitrate reductase activities between the two treatments were very similar for both species. These different responses together with differences in the nitrogen productivity of the two species suggest that the level of nutrient availability may play an important role in the distribution of these Bromus species in natural habitats.},

abstract = {We investigated the differential roles of physiological and morphological features on seedling survivorship along an experimental irradiance gradient in four dominant species of cool temperate-Mediterranean forests (Quercus robur L., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.). The lowest photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm in dark-adapted leaves) was reached in deep shade (1% of full sunlight) in all species except Q. robur, which had the lowest photochemical efficiency in both deep shade and 100% of full sunlight. Species differed significantly in their survival in 1% of full sunlight but exhibited similar survivorship in 6, 20 and 100% of full sunlight. Shade-tolerant oaks had lower leaf area ratios, shoot to root ratios, foliage allocation ratios and higher rates of allocation to structural biomass (stem plus thick roots) than shade-intolerant pines. Overall phenotypic plasticity for each species, estimated as the difference between the minimum and the maximum mean values of the ecophysiological variables studied at the various irradiances divided by the maximum mean value of those variables, was inversely correlated with shade tolerance. Observed morphology, allocation and plasticity conformed to a conservative resource-use strategy, although observed differences in specific leaf area, which was higher in shade-tolerant species, supported a carbon gain maximization strategy. Lack of a congruent suite of traits underlying shade tolerance in the studied species provides evidence of adaptation to multiple selective forces. Although the study was based on only four species, the importance of ecophysiological variables as determinants of interspecific differences in survival in limiting light was demonstrated.},

Growth rate, development time and body size at maturity were studied at different temperature regimes with discreteness of insect growth pattern, associated with moultings, taken into account. Moreover, the temperature effect on reproductive strategy of females was tested, and the general life history was compared with available data within the wood-feeding guild. The results show that: (i) the growth of A. rubra is slow but compensated by prolonged development; (ii) size dimorphism is probably caused by the longer development time of females; (iii) fecundity is at least partly determined by the temperature experienced during the egg-laying period; and (iv) interspecific comparisons reveal that the life strategy of a wood-feeder depends on the niche occupied within the tree, whilst its breeding strategy (whether capital or income) is controlled at a taxonomic level. Control of all the main life history traits at one time provided a unique opportunity to understand the selection pressures on A. rubra species. Moreover, comparison within a feeding guild broadens this context and identifies the sources of heterogeneity in the 'inside-wood' habitat. The knowledge so gathered may be applied to pest control in forestry science, as well as to the conservation of rare and endangered insect species living within trees.},

abstract = {The present study examines relative growth rate (RGR) and its determinants in seedlings of nine Eucalyptus species. Species were selected from mesic (1,800 mm a(-1) rainfall) through to semi-arid habitats (300 mm a(-1)), and thus, notionally vary in "stress" tolerance. Seedlings were grown in a glasshouse during early summer and received between 33 mol and 41 mol PAR m(-2) day(-1) . The mean RGR varied among species-from a minimum of 66 mg g(-1) day(-1) in E. hypochlamydea to a maximum of 106 mg g(-1) day(-1) in E. delegatensis. RGR was positively related to rainfall at the sites of seed collection. Neither specific leaf area (SLA) nor net assimilation rate was related to rainfall or RGR. While the absence of relationships with SLA and net assimilation rate contrasts with other studies and species, we cannot rule out the effects of sample size (n=9 species) and modest ranges in SLA and RGR. The ratio of leaf mass to total mass (LMR) varied from 0.49+/-0.07 g g(-1) in E. socialis to 0.74+/-0.04 g g(-1) in E. delegatensis and was strongly positively related with rainfall (r2=0.77). Interspecific differences in RGR were strongly related to LMR (positive relationship, r2=0.50) and the rate of dry matter production per mol of leaf nitrogen (positive relationship, r2=0.64). Hence, the slow RGR of low-rainfall species was functionally related to a lower growth rate per mol of leaf nitrogen than high-rainfall species. Furthermore, slow RGR of low-rainfall species was related to greater allocation to roots at the expense of leaves. Increasing allocation to roots versus leaves is likely an adaptation to soil and atmospheric water deficits, but one that comes at the expense of a slow RGR.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Understanding the factors influencing tree growth is central to forest ecology because of the significance of growth to forest structure and biomass. One of the simplest, yet most controversial growth models, proposed by Enquist and colleagues, predicts that stem-diameter growth scales as the one-third power of stem diameter. Recent analyses of large-scale data sets have challenged the generality of this theory and highlighted the influence of resource competition on the scaling of growth with size. 2. Here we explore the factors regulating the diameter growth of 3334 trees of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) growing in natural single-species forests in New Zealand. Maximum-likelihood modelling was used to quantify the influences of tree size, altitude, the basal area of taller neighbours (BL) and the basal area of all neighbours (BT) on growth. Our interpretation of the models assumed that taller neighbours compete for light whereas all neighbours compete for nutrients. 3. The regression analyses indicate that competition for light has a strong influence on the growth of small trees, whereas competition for nutrients affects trees of all sizes. These findings are consistent with experimental manipulation studies showing that competition for light and nutrients inhibits the growth of small mountain beech trees, and fertilizer application studies showing that nitrogen limits the growth of large trees. 4. Tree growth declined with altitude. The regression analyses suggest that the intensity of light competition also declines with altitude, when trees with similar BT and BL values were compared along the gradient. These results are consistent with observations that trees become stunted and have more open canopies at high altitudes. 5. Our study is the first to build the effects of competition and environment into Enquist's model of tree growth. We show that competitive interactions alter the scaling of mean growth rate with size, whereas altitude does not influence the scaling of potential growth rate with size.

A measure of adult size, the 95th percentile of trunk diameter of all diameters $\ge$0.1{\texttimes}maximum observed diameter (D950.1) was found to be independent of species abundance and highly correlated with maximum height. D950.1 was determined for 573 species with at least 20 trees with diameters $\ge$0.1{\texttimes}maximum observed diameter in old-growth, lowland evergreen forest on the 50-ha forest dynamics plot at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia. These species, comprising 98.3% of all trees $\ge$1cm diameter in the plot, were then divided into five life forms of differing stature; shrubs (D950.1<5cm), treelets (5cm$\le$D950.1<12cm), understory trees (12cm$\le$D950.1<25cm), canopy trees (25cm$\le$D950.1<60cm) and emergents (D950.1$\ge$60cm). Each life form showed a distinctive pattern of mortality versus trunk diameter, but all showed higher mortality in the largest diameter class per life form. Mean growth rates increased with trunk diameter within each life form, consistent with reported increases in irradiance with height at Pasoh. Among trees of similar diameter, growth rates increased across life forms from the smallest to largest. These differences in growth rate among life forms may be due to associated differences in allometry, photosynthetic capacity and reproductive allocation.},

These species represent a variety of ecological traits and include those in the genera Populus, Quercus, Pinus, Tsuga and Nyssa. We found that most trees in all age classes and species exhibit an increasing BAI throughout their lives. This is particularly unusual for trees in the older age classes that we expected to have declining growth in the later years, as predicted by physiological growth models. There exists an inverse relationship between growth rate and increasing age class. The oldest trees within each species have consistently slow growth throughout their lives, implying an inverse relationship between growth rate and longevity. Younger trees (< 60 years of age) within each species are consistently growing faster than the older trees when they are of the same age resulting from a higher proportion of fast-growing trees in these young age classes. Slow, but increasing, BAI in the oldest trees in recent decades is a continuation of their growth pattern established in previous centuries. The fact that they have not shown a decreasing growth rate in their old age contradicts physiological growth models and may be related to the stimulatory effects of global change phenomenon (climate and land-use history).},

It is unknown whether this is a direct response or whether inter-specific differences in growth are simply correlated with other physiological or morphological differences among species that affect the growth response to CO(2). Here we use intra-specific variation in Picea glauca to examine the mechanistic basis for this relationship. Relative growth rate (RGR) of 29 genotypes grown at ambient (370 {\textmu}l l(-1)) or elevated (740 {\textmu}l 1(-1)) CO(2) was measured. Physiological and morphological traits describing differences in allocation, canopy structure, stomatal function and photosynthesis were determined. Most variation in RGR (74%) was explained by traits associated with canopy structure. Although there was a strong correlation between RGR(740) and RGR(370), we found no evidence that genotypes that grew fast at ambient CO(2) had a greater relative growth response to CO(2). Given that the pattern found at the intra-specific level differed from that reported at the inter-specific level, our results suggest that RGR per se does not affect the growth response to CO(2). Rather, the CO(2) growth response is determined by traits that may or may not be correlated with RGR.},

Disturbances within these regions generally were due to small, single-tree gaps averaging 155 m2 for the saplings studied. In such gaps, average height growth was found to be about 30 cm/yr with species averages ranging from 18 to 49 cm/yr. The most commonly sampled species increased in growth rate in the order, Fagus grandifolia, Acer saccharum, Tilia heterophylla, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Halesia carolina. Topographic factors (i.e., slope, elevation, and aspect) and gap size and age were analyzed using a stepwise multivariate regression procedure. In general, the most rapid growth occurred for taller saplings in large young gaps in protected hillsides at lower elevations.},

We grew 'Cleopatra' mandarin (CM) seedlings, budded trees of 'Salustiano' orange (SAO) on CM, 'Valencia Late' orange (VLO) on CM (VLO/CM), and interstock trees VLO/SAO/CM in pots of sand watered with nutrient solution containing 5 (control) or 50 mM NaCl for 12 weeks. Plants were harvested on six successive occasions and the time trends in relative growth rate (RGR) and its components were estimated by fitting a Richards function regression to the harvest data. At low and high salinities, the VLO/SAO/CM combination had higher mean RGR than VLO/CM. Under control conditions, the increase in RGR caused by the interstock was the result of an increase in leaf mass fraction (LMF; leaf dry mass/plant dry mass ratio). Increases in net assimilation rate on a leaf mass basis (NARm) and LMF contributed equally to the increase in RGR in saline conditions, their growth response coefficients being 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. The structural modifications, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR; leaf area:plant dry mass ratio), had a slight influence on the reduction in RGR by salinity. However, NARm had a large influence on RGR, except in CM. The interstock-induced mechanism increased biomass allocation to the assimilatory organs and, under saline conditions, increased Cl- and Na+ allocations to roots. Thus, the flux of ions to the leaves was either delayed or reduced or both. The dilution of imported ions by foliar growth reduced ion concentrations in leaves, resulting in higher NARm, which together with higher LMF, increased RGR.},

abstract = {Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {This paper reports general patterns of relative growth rate and related traits in response to elevated atmospheric CO$_2$ in eight woody species ranging widely in life form, leaf habit, taxonomy and ecology. Young plants of these species, all of comparable ontogenetic phases, were grown simultaneously in large containers with favourable nutrient and water availability in transparent outdoor chambers at 350 and 700 $\mu$l l$^{-1}$ CO$_2$ for one growing season. We found the following consistent responses. (1) All species grew faster at elevated CO$_2$, whereas the following leaf and allocation traits were consistently lower in CO$_2$-enriched environments: specific leaf area (quotient of leaf area and leaf weight), leaf area ratio (quotient of total leaf area and plant weight), weight-based foliar N concentration and, to a smaller extent, leaf weight fraction (quotient of leaf weight and plant weight). (2) There was important interspecific variation in the magnitude of the response of relative growth rate to CO$_2$. Specific leaf area at ambient CO$_2$ explained 88% of the variation in relative growth rate response to CO$_2$ among the eight species. At ambient CO$_2$, relative growth rate itself, was significantly correlated with the relative growth rate response to CO$_2$ only if the leafless species Ulex gallii was excluded from analysis. (3) The four deciduous species had a significantly stronger relative growth rate response to CO$_2$ than the four evergreens. This corresponded with their generally higher specific leaf area. (4) Specific leaf area and leaf habit might be useful for scaling up exercises, as easy-to-measure substitutes for growth responses of (woody) vegetation to elevated CO$_2$. However, the usefulness of such traits in this context needs to be tested in realistic, longer-term manipulative experiments in real ecosystems.},

abstract = {A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.},

abstract = {Air temperatures have risen over the past 50 yr along the Antarctic Peninsula, and it is unclear what impact this is having on Antarctic plants. We examined the growth response of the Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis (Caryophyllaceae) and Deschampsia antarctica (Poaceae) to temperature and also assessed their ability for thermal acclimation, in terms of whole-canopy net photosynthesis (P(n)) and dark respiration (R(d)), by growing plants for 90 d under three contrasting temperature regimes: 7{\textdegree}C day/7{\textdegree}C night, 12{\textdegree}C day/7{\textdegree}C night, and 20{\textdegree}C day/7{\textdegree}C night (18 h/6 h). These daytime temperatures represent suboptimal (7{\textdegree}C), near-optimal (12{\textdegree}C), and supraoptimal (20{\textdegree}C) temperatures for P(n) based on field measurements at the collection site near Palmer Station along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Plants of both species grown at a daytime temperature of 20{\textdegree}C had greater RGR (relative growth rate) and produced 2.2-3.3 times as much total biomass as plants grown at daytime temperatures of 12{\textdegree} or 7{\textdegree}C. Plants grown at 20{\textdegree}C also produced 2.0-4.1 times as many leaves, 3.4-5.5 times as much total leaf area, and had 1.5-1.6 times the LAR (leaf area ratio; leaf area:total biomass) and 1.1-1.4 times the LMR (leaf mass ratio; leaf mass:total biomass) of plants grown at 12{\textdegree} or 7{\textdegree}C. Greater RGR and biomass production at 20{\textdegree}C appeared primarily due to greater biomass allocation to leaf production in these plants. Rates of P(n) (leaf-area basis), when measured at their respective daytime growth temperatures, were highest in plants grown at 12{\textdegree}C, and rates of plants grown at 20{\textdegree}C were only 58 (C. quitensis) or 64% (D. antarctica) of the rates in plants grown at 12{\textdegree}C. Thus, lower P(n) per leaf area in plants grown at 20{\textdegree}C was more than offset by much greater leaf-area production. Rates of whole-canopy P(n) (per plant), when measured at their respective daytime growth temperatures, were highest in plants grown at 20{\textdegree}C, and appeared well correlated with differences in RGR and total biomass among treatments. Colobanthus quitensis exhibited only a slight ability for relative acclimation of P(n) (leaf-area basis) as the optimal temperature for P(n) increased from 8.4{\textdegree} to 10.3{\textdegree} to 11.5{\textdegree}C as daytime growth temperatures increased from 7{\textdegree} to 12{\textdegree} to 20{\textdegree}C. There was no evidence for relative acclimation of P(n) in D. antarctica, as plants grown at all three temperature regimes had a similar optimal temperature (10{\textdegree}C) for P(n). There was no evidence for absolute acclimation of P(n) in either species, as rates of P(n) in plants grown at a daytime temperature of 12{\textdegree}C were higher than those of plants grown at daytime temperatures of 7{\textdegree} or 20{\textdegree}C, when measured at their respective growth temperatures. The poor ability for photosynthetic acclimation in these species may be associated with the relatively stable maritime temperature regime during the growing season along the Peninsula. In contrast to P(n), both species exhibited full acclimation of R(d), and rates of R(d) on a leaf-area basis were similar among treatments when measured at their respective daytime growth temperature. Our results suggest that in the absence of interspecific competition, continued warming along the Peninsula will lead to improved vegetative growth of these species due to (1) greater biomass allocation to leaf-area production (as opposed to improved rates of P(n) per leaf area) and (2) their ability to acclimate R(d), such that respiratory losses per leaf area do not increase under higher temperature regimes.},

abstract = {Lianas differ from trees in many life history characteristics, and we predicted that they are phenotypically more responsive to environmental variation than trees. We analyzed responsiveness to light and nutrient availability of five Bauhinia species (three lianas and two trees). Seedlings were grown in a shade house in two light regimes (5 and 25% of full sunlight) and two nutrient supply regimes (field soil and N fertilization equivalent to 100 kg ha(-1)), and important growth-related physiological and morphological plant parameters were measured. Light availability affected most of the measured variables, whereas N addition had only weak effects. In the four light-demanding species (two lianas and two trees), relative plant biomass growth rate increased and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with increased light availability, whereas a shade-tolerant liana did not respond. Leaf N concentration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area increased in response to increased irradiance or soil N in the light-demanding tree species and the shade-tolerant liana, but not in the two light-demanding lianas. The light-demanding lianas also had higher SLA and leaf mass ratio, resulting in a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) in high light, whereas the light-demanding trees did not. Across all treatments, mean plasticity indices of physiological and morphological traits, and all traits combined were similar among the studied species. Plasticity was higher in response to light than to N, indicating that light is the main factor controlling seedling responses of the studied species. Although lianas and trees did not differ in mean plasticity in response to light and N, the light-demanding lianas were phenotypically less plastic in LAR and in photosynthetic rates and biomass allocation than the trees. Light and N interacted in their effects on most physiological variables, but the consequences for relative growth rate differed little among species. We conclude that, contrary to our predictions, lianas were no more responsive to variation in light and N availability than trees.},

abstract = {Total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) of roots were sampled in early autumn from saplings of four species that differ in light-dependent growth and survivorship ("shade tolerance"). The two deciduous species (Acer saccharum and Fraxinus americana) had higher TNC concentrations than the evergreens (Tsuga canadensis and Pinus strobus), presumably because of autumn build-up of reserves for spring refoliation. In separate comparisons of deciduous and coniferous pairs, A. saccharum and T. canadensis had higher low-light TNC concentrations and survivorship than F. americana and P. strobus, respectively. In high light, TNC levels were not significantly different between A. saccharum and F. americana and both species had gt 98% survivorship. An analytical model of carbohydrate allocation demonstrates that variation in storage allocation can influence survivorship and growth and that the opportunity cost of storage is lower under low light. The model and empirical data are consistent with an observed correlation among species between growth determinancy and shade tolerance and a negative correlation between high-light growth rates and low-light survivorship. Allocation to storage may be an effective strategy of shade tolerance because it is relatively inexpensive under low light and provides a buffer against stresses.},

abstract = {Question: Do species traits explain differences in productivity in grazed and ungrazed plots? Location: R{\'\i}o de la Plata grasslands, Uruguay (31{\textdegree}54'S, 58{\textdegree}15'W). Methods: In a greenhouse experiment, we measured the relative growth rate (RGR) of grasses with contrasting responses to grazing (increasers and decreasers). We performed six harvests at weekly intervals in order to calculate the RGR and assess 12 plant traits. We compared the RGR between increaser and decreaser species after 2 and 5 weeks using /-tests. Linear and potential regression models were fitted to time versus natural logarithm of total dry biomass relationships. The RGR temporal trajectories of increaser and decreaser species were obtained from the derivatives of the best-fit functions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to sort species according to their traits. Results: The RGR of decreaser grasses was higher than that of increasers at the second week, while at the fifth week the opposite was observed. The RGR of decreasers dropped through time, while the RGR of increaser species was constant. The PCA separated increaser from decreaser species. The attributes related to increaser species were: high specific leaf area, tillering rate, green leaf rate, total leaf number, root weight ratio and leaf weight ratio; while those associated with decreaser species were: high dead biomass, senescence rate, reproductive biomass, leaf elongation rate and total biomass. Conclusions: Traits possessed by decreasers reduce light availability and increase the reproductive investment, explaining the drop in RGR. Specific differences in RGR seem to scale up to the ecosystem level and would explain the pattern in aboveground net primary production observed in the field under contrasting grazing regimes.},

Species represented a range of shade tolerance, but all individuals were measured in light gaps to control for environmental conditions and the availability of herbivores. Species growth rates and leaf lifetimes differed by almost 50-fold and were related to the degree of shade tolerance. Various measures of plant growth were significantly negatively correlated with an estimate of defense investment, and significantly positive correlated with rates of herbivory. Species with long-lived leaves had significantly higher concentrations of immobile defenses such as tannins and lignins. These data support current hypotheses that the intrinsic growth rate of a species evolutionarily determines the optimal amount and type of defense.},

abstract = {Measurements of CO2 efflux from stems and branches, sap velocity, and respiratory activity of excised wood cores were conducted in Dacrydium cupressinum trees that differed in diameter, age, and canopy emergence. The objective of this study was to determine if consistent linkages exist among respiratory production of CO2 within stems, xylem transport of CO2, and the rate of CO2 diffusing from stem surfaces. Stem CO2 efflux was depressed during periods of sap flow compared with the efflux rate expected for a given stem temperature and was positively correlated with sapwood density. By contrast, no significant relationships were observed between CO2 efflux and the respiratory activity of wood tissues. Between 86 and 91% of woody tissue respiration diffused to the atmosphere over a 24-h period. However, at certain times of the day, xylem transport and internal storage of CO2 may account for up to 13-38% and 12-18%, respectively, of woody tissue respiration. These results demonstrate that differences in sap flow rates and xylem anatomy are critically important for explaining within- and between-tree variation in CO2 efflux from stems.},

There exists an informal shortlist of plant traits that are thought to be most informative. Here, we summarize recent research on correlations and tradeoffs surrounding some traits that are prospects for the shortlist.

abstract = {Niche differentiation is a major hypothesized determinant of species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches have been used to infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which hardly has been done. We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for shade tolerance), water compensation points (proxy for drought tolerance) and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale ({\textasciitilde}1 km2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100-2200 mm/y) at regional ({\textasciitilde}1000 km) scale. We show that the water compensation point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the water compensation point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain - both driven by leaf area index and the leaf nitrogen concentration - also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change.},

The relationship between abundance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the under appreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relationships between size and abundance that are often confused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them. We argue that a synthetic understanding of size-abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

abstract = {1. There is limited understanding of patterns of variation that exist among root traits of different species, especially under field conditions. We contrasted 11 fast- and slow-growing species paired within five evolutionary lineages to investigate whether root traits associated with soil resource acquisition were related to species' potential growth rate. 2. Measurements of root morphology, architecture, nitrogen and phenolic concentration, respiration and phosphorus uptake were taken on fine, non-woody roots sampled from forest stands in central Pennsylvania, USA. 3. Across all five contrasts, roots of fast-growing species generally had higher specific root length, smaller diameters, greater degree of branching, and lower phenolic concentrations than those of slow-growing species. This suggests differences in potential soil exploration and root defences among species differing in potential growth rate. 4. There were no significant differences between fast- and slow-growing species in root tissue density, respiration or P uptake. Lack of root physiological differences between species differing in growth rate contrasted with previous research on chamber-grown seedlings. 5. These results imply that, while roots of fast-growing species may be constructed for more rapid soil exploration and shorter life span than those of slow-growing species, root physiology is either more closely tied to overall plant physiology, which is more similar among mature trees, or masked by variation in soil microsites, root age or interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.},

abstract = {Relative growth rate (RGR) is currently the most commonly used method for measuring and comparing species' intrinsic growth potential. Comparative studies have, for example, revealed that small-seeded species have higher RGR, leading to the common belief that small-seeded species possess physiological adaptations for rapid growth that would allow them to outgrow large-seeded species, given sufficient time. We show that, because RGR declines as individual plants grow, it is heavily biased by initial size and does not measure the size-corrected growth potential that determines the outcome of competition in the long term. We develop a daily growth model that includes a simple mechanistic representation of aboveground and belowground growth and its dependency on plant size and environmental factors. Intrinsic growth potential is encapsulated by the size-independent growth coefficient, G. We parameterized the model using repeated-harvest data from 1724 plants of nine species growing in contrasting nutrient and temperature regimes. Using information-theoretic criteria, we found evidence for interspecific differences in only three of nine model parameters: G, aboveground allocation, and frost damage. With other parameters shared between species, the model accurately reproduced above- and belowground biomass trajectories for all nine species in each set of environmental conditions. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the relationship between G and seed size was positive, despite a strong negative correlation between seed size and average RGR, meaning that large-seeded rather than small-seeded species have higher size-corrected growth potential. Further, we found a significant positive correlation between G and frost damage that, according to simulations, causes rank reversals in final biomass under daily temperature changes of {\textpm}5{\textdegree}C. We recommend the wider use of this new kind of plant growth analysis as a better way of understanding underlying differences in species' physiology; but we recognize that RGR is still a useful metric if considering the potential rate of population increase in empty habitats.},

To examine how these disturbance-dependent invasive species exploit resource pulses resulting from disturbance, twelve physiological and morphological traits, including age-dependent responsiveness in leaf traits to nitrogen pulse, were compared between Bischofia javanica, an invasive tree species in Ogasawara islands, and three native Ogasawara species, each having a different successional status. When exposed to a nitrogen pulse, invasive B. javanica showed higher increases in photosynthetic capacity, leaf area, epidermal cell number and cell size in leaves of broad age classes, and root nitrogen absorption ability than two native mid-/late or late-successional species, but showed no particular superiority to a native pioneer species in these responses. Under low nitrogen, however, it showed the largest relative growth rate among the four species, while the native pioneer showed the lowest growth. From these results, we concluded that the combination of moderately high responsiveness to resource pulses and the ability to maintain steady growth under resource limitations may give B. javanica a competitive advantage over a series of native species with different successional status from early to late-successional stages.},

abstract = {1. Studies have shown that differences in height growth rates are characteristic of tree species that differ in understory tolerance and relative successional status. Less-tolerant species have greater juvenile height growth rates than more-tolerant species and thus, in a mixed-species forest, the former gain an early competitive advantage after a stand-initiating disturbance. Species-level height stratification is the predicted outcome under this model. 2. Silvicultural evidence suggests that a species-level differential growth rate model is idealistic because height stratification among species differing in understory tolerance is not consistently expressed within an even-aged forest. Stratification may fail to develop if individuals of a relatively tolerant species are competitively uninhibited, establish earlier than less-tolerant species, or are of vegetative-origin. 3. The establishment and height growth histories of three species differing in understory tolerance were examined within two forests in northern Michigan, USA. Objectives of the study included: (i) determining if species height stratification paralleling understory tolerance was a characteristic of these forests; (ii) assessing the degree of height variation within species populations; and (iii) determining if species age distributions, changes in individual competitive environments, or regenerative origin influenced population height structures. 4. In both forests, Populus grandidentata, an intolerant, early successional species was typically taller than Quercus rubra, a mid-tolerant, later successional species, which in turn was taller than Acer rubrum, a tolerant, later successional species. However within Quercus and Acer populations, heights were often highly variable, with some individuals equalling the heights of Populus. Age differences had no influence on height patterns. 5. Growth rate differences among surviving stems determined species stratification patterns and height variation within populations. Populus typically outgrew both Quercus and Acer, although some individuals of the latter two species had height growth rates equivalent to Populus. Most Quercus and Acer appeared to be of vegetative origin, as were all Populus ramets. For individuals of the former two species, potential juvenile height growth rates were likely greater than that of true seedlings, thus allowing some individuals to match growth rates of Populus. 6. Populus numerically dominated the forests because a large proportion of growing space was occupied by its rot systems and ramets, relative to Quercus and Acer. Vertical domination by Populus was apparently the result of competitive inhibition of most, but not all, Quercus and Acer, not because of inherent, species-specific differences in juvenile height growth rates.},

abstract = {A trade-off between growth in high-light and survival in low-light of species is often proposed as a key mechanism underpinning the dynamics of trees in forest communities. Yet, growth and survival are known to depend on plant size and few studies have analysed how this trade-off can vary between juvenile life stages and the potential consequences of the trade-off for the differences in regeneration rate between species in mixed forests. We quantified growth and mortality for two different juvenile life stages 2013 seedlings and saplings 2013 of seven tree species common in temperate rain forests in New Zealand using data from field studies. We found strong evidence that the ranking of species for survival in shade and growth in full light was affected by size. There was a trade-off between seedling survival in low light and sapling height growth in high light, but no trade-offs were observed when considering other combinations of life stages (seedling growth vs. seedling survival, seedling growth vs. sapling survival, or sapling growth vs. sapling survival). We ran simulations with an individual-based forest dynamics model 2013 {SORTIE/NZ} 2013 to explore how the trade-off drives the differences in tree species regeneration success in gaps vs. under closed forest conditions. These simulations indicate that because species' ranks in shade tolerance varied with life stage, regeneration success was not predicted from knowledge of tree performance at a single life stage. For instance, high-light sapling growth was a strong determinant of regeneration success in forest gaps, but seedling growth was also influential. Under closed forest, regeneration success was primarily limited by low-light mortality at the seedling stage, but seedling growth and sapling survival were also influential. Synthesis. Growth-survival trade-offs can be strongly affected by the size of the individual analysed, resulting in completely different rankings of the shade tolerance of species across different juvenile life stages. Performance of both seedlings and saplings influenced regeneration success, highlighting the need to consider growth-survival trade-offs and the shade-tolerance strategies of tree species over a large range of juvenile sizes.},

One such evolutionary trade-off assumes a decrease in growth rate with increasing investment in chemical defences in species adapted to different levels of habitat fertility. 2. To test this hypothesis, we grew 31 herbaceous species of Asteraceae under controlled conditions of temperature (25<sup>⚬</sup>C), humidity (80%), light (500 $\mu$mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and photoperiod (16 h day<sup>-1</sup>) in a modified Hoagland hydroponic solution. The plants grew from seed for 35 days post-germination and were harvested at 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated as well as a general measure of potential phytochemical toxicity (LC<sub>50</sub>) using an alcohol extraction of secondary compounds followed by Brine Shrimp bioassay and an assay of total phenolics. 3. The interspecific correlation between RGR and the potential phytochemical toxicity was weak and non-significant (r<sub>S</sub> = 0.12, P = 0.53). The correlation between RGR and total phenolics was weak, positive but significant (r<sub>S</sub> = 0.40, P = 0.03). 4. These results suggest that such an evolutionary trade-off does not exist in this group of Asteraceae.},

The percentage of recruits located in tree-fall gaps (P), sapling growth (G), and mortality (M) rates, and the coefficient of skewness of size distributions (g1 were determined from censuses of all individuals >10 mm dbh in a 50-ha plot. Seven qualitative, bivariate predictions relating g1, G, M, P, and wood density (W) were evaluated. Six of the seven predictions were substantiated in pairwise analyses. A path analysis integrated all seven predictions and explained 51% of the interspecific variation in g1. Size distributions with many large individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, small individuals ($g_1 < 0$) characterized gap-dependent species with large fecundity, seed mortality, seedling mortality, G, M, and P. Size distributions with many small individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, large individuals ($g_1 > 0$) characterized shade-tolerant species with the opposite traits. The percentage of tropical tree species that require tree-fall gaps to regenerate has been estimated to range from <20% to >70% for old-growth forests. Our analyses suggest that there are not large numbers of functionally equivalent species at either extreme of the regeneration continuum. Rather, there are very few extremely shade-tolerant and extremely light-demanding species. Most species have intermediate light requirements and lifestyles.},

The trees sampled were growing 15 and 30 m from a motorway and at a background rural site in southern Finland. Litter decomposition was also measured at both the roadside and rural sites. Height and diameter growth rate and specific leaf area were lowest, and epicuticular wax amount highest in trees growing 15m from the motorway. Although no significant distance {\texttimes} clone interactions were detected, clone-based analyses indicated differences in genotypic responses to motorway proximity. Leaf N concentration did not differ with distance from the motorway for any of the clones. Leaf litter decomposition was only temporarily retarded in the roadside environment, suggesting minor effects on nutrient cycling.},

Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth-survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

Species{\textquoteright} occurrence along water availability gradients depends on their ability to tolerate drought. * 2To identify species{\textquoteright} traits underlying drought-tolerance we excavated first year seedlings of 62 dry and moist forest tree species at the onset of the dry season. We evaluate how morphological seedling traits differ between forests, and whether functional groups of species can be identified based on trait relations. We also compare seedling traits along independent axes of drought and shade-tolerance to assess a hypothesized trade-off. * 3Seedlings of dry forest species improve water foraging capacity in deep soil layers by an increased below-ground biomass allocation and by having deep roots. They minimize the risk of cavitation by making dense stems, and reduce transpiration by producing less leaf tissue. Moist forest seedlings have large leaf areas and a greater above-ground biomass, to maximize light interception, and long, cheap, branched root systems, to increase water and nutrient capture. * 4Associations among seedling traits reveal three major drought strategies: (i) evergreen drought-tolerant species have high biomass investment in enduring organs, minimize cavitation and minimize transpiration to persist under dry conditions; (ii) drought-avoiding species maximize resource capture during a limited growing season and then avoid stress with a deciduous leaf habit in the dry season; (iii) drought-intolerant species maximize both below- and above-ground resource capture to increase competitiveness for light, but are consequently precluded from dry habitats. * 5We found no direct trade-off between drought- and shade-tolerance, because they depend largely on different morphological adaptations. Drought-tolerance is supported by a high biomass investment to the root system, whereas shade-tolerance is mainly promoted by a low growth rate and low SLA. * 6Synthesis. We conclude that there are three general adaptation strategies of drought-tolerance, which seemingly hold true across biomes and for different life forms. Drought- and shade-tolerance are largely independent from one another, suggesting a high potential for niche differentiation, as species{\textquoteright} specialization can occur at different combinations of water and light availability.},

abstract = {1Interspecific variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25{\textendash}1180~mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2{\textendash}5% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central Chile.2As predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio (LAR) of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light LAR fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over $\approx$500~mm tall.3Although the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or Aristotelia.4Above-ground relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to LAR, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings (400~mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining LAR and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low light.5Results are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.},

abstract = {There is limited evidence regarding the adaptive value of plant functional traits in contrasting light environments. It has been suggested that changes in these traits in response to light availability can increase herbivore susceptibility. We tested the adaptive value of plant functional traits linked with carbon gain in contrasting light environments and also evaluated whether herbivores can modify selection on these traits in each light environment. In a temperate rainforest, we examined phenotypic selection on functional traits in seedlings of the pioneer tree Aristotelia chilensis growing in sun (canopy gap) and shade (forest understory) and subjected to either natural herbivory or herbivore exclusion. We found differential selection on functional traits depending on light environment. In sun, there was positive directional selection on photosynthetic rate and relative growth rate (RGR), indicating that selection favors competitive ability in a high-resource environment. Seedlings with high specific leaf area (SLA) and intermediate RGR were selected in shade, suggesting that light capture and conservative resource use are favored in the understory. Herbivores reduced the strength of positive directional selection acting on SLA in shade. We provide the first demonstration that natural herbivory rates can change the strength of selection on plant ecophysiological traits, that is, attributes whose main function is resource uptake. Research addressing the evolution of shade tolerance should incorporate the selective role of herbivores.},

abstract = {Accurate knowledge of carbon (C) content in live wood is essential for quantifying tropical forest C stocks, yet generic assumptions (such as biomass consisting of 50% carbon on a weight/weight basis) remain widely used despite being supported by little chemical analysis. Empirical data from stem cores of 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species demonstrate that wood C content is highly variable among co-occurring species, with an average (47.4{\textpm}2.51% S.D.) significantly lower than widely assumed values. Prior published values have neglected to account for volatile C content of tropical woods. By comparing freeze- and oven-dried wood samples, we show that volatile C is non-negligible, and excluding the volatile fraction underestimates wood C content by 2.48{\textpm}1.28% (S.D.) on average. Wood C content varied substantially among species (from 41.9-51.6%), but was neither strongly phylogenetically conserved, nor correlated to ecological (i.e. wood density, maximum tree height) or demographic traits (i.e. relative growth rate, mortality rate). Overall, assuming generic C fractions in tropical wood overestimates forest C stocks by ∼3.3-5.3%, a non-trivial margin of error leading to overestimates of 4.1-6.8 Mg C ha(-1) in a 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In addition to addressing other sources of error in tropical forest C accounting, such as uncertainties in allometric models and belowground biomass, compilation and use of species-specific C fractions for tropical tree species would substantially improve both local and global estimates of terrestrial C stocks and fluxes.},

Although nutrient limitations are expected to select for resource-conservative strategies, water limitations may select for either resource-conservative or -acquisitive strategies. We test whether population differentiation reflects local adaptation for traits associated with resource-use strategies in a desert annual (Helianthus anomalus) distributed along a gradient of positively covarying water and nutrient availability. {\textbullet} We compared quantitative trait variation (Q(ST)) with neutral genetic differentiation (F(ST)), in a common garden glasshouse study, for leaf economics spectrum (LES) and related traits: photosynthesis (A(mass), A(area)), leaf nitrogen (N(mass), N(area)), leaf lifetime (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf water content (LWC), water-use efficiency (WUE, estimated as $\delta$(13)C) and days to first flower (DFF). {\textbullet} Q(ST)-F(ST) differences support adaptive differentiation for Amass , N(mass), N(area), LWC and DFF. The trait combinations associated with drier and lower fertility sites represent correlated trait evolution consistent with the more resource-acquisitive end of the LES. There was no evidence for adaptive differentiation for A(area), LMA and WUE. {\textbullet} These results demonstrate that hot dry environments can selectively favor correlated evolution of traits contributing to a resource-acquisitive and earlier reproduction 'escape' strategy, despite lower fertility.},

abstract = {Optimal carbon allocation to growth, defense, or storage is a critical trait in determining the shade tolerance of tree species. Thus, examining interspecific differences in carbon allocation patterns is useful when evaluating niche partitioning in forest communities. We hypothesized that shade-tolerant species allocate more carbon to defense and storage and less to growth compared to shade-intolerant species. In gaps and forest understory, we measured relative growth rates (RGR), carbon-based defensive compounds (condensed tannin, total phenolics), and storage compounds (total non-structural carbohydrate; TNC) in seedlings of two tree species differing in shade tolerance. RGR was greater in the shade-intolerant species, Castanea crenata, than in the shade-tolerant species, Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata, in gaps, but did not differ between the species in the forest understory. In contrast, concentrations of condensed tannin and total phenolics were greater in Quercus than in Castanea at both sites. TNC pool sizes did not differ between the species. Condensed tannin concentrations increased with increasing growth rate of structural biomass (GRstr) in Quercus but not in Castanea. TNC pool sizes increased with increasing GRstr in both species, but the rate of increase did not differ between the species. Accordingly, the amount of condensed tannin against TNC pool sizes was usually higher in Quercus than in Castanea. Hence, Quercus preferentially invested more carbon in defense than in storage. Such a large allocation of carbon to defense would be advantageous for a shade-tolerant species, allowing Quercus to persist in the forest understory where damage from herbivores and pathogens is costly. In contrast, the shade-intolerant Castanea preferentially invested more carbon in growth rather than defense (and similar amounts in storage as Quercus), ensuring establishment success in gaps, where severe competition occurs for light among neighboring plants.

abstract = {At northern latitudes a rise in atmospheric humidity and precipitation is predicted as a consequence of global climate change. We studied several growth and functional traits of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L.{\texttimes}P. tremuloides Michx.) in response to elevated atmospheric humidity (on average 7% over the ambient level) in a free air experimental facility during three growing seasons (2008-2010) in Estonia, which represents northern temperate climate (boreo-nemoral zone). Data were collected from three humidified (H) and three control (C) plots, and analysed using nested linear models. Elevated air humidity significantly reduced height, stem diameter and stem volume increments and transpiration of the trees whereas these effects remained highly significant also after considering the side effects from soil-related confounders within the 2.7 ha study area. Tree leaves were smaller, lighter and had lower leaf mass per area (LMA) in H plots. The magnitude and significance of the humidity treatment effect--inhibition of above-ground growth rate--was more pronounced in larger trees. The lower growth rate in the humidified plots can be partly explained by a decrease in transpiration-driven mass flow of NO(3) (-) in soil, resulting in a significant reduction in the measured uptake of N to foliage in the H plots. The results suggest that the potential growth improvement of fast-growing trees like aspens, due to increasing temperature and atmospheric CO(2) concentration, might be smaller than expected at high latitudes if a rise in atmospheric humidity simultaneously takes place.},

abstract = {Specific leaf area (SLA) is a key functional trait reflecting the trade-off between resource capture and conservation, and has been identified as playing an important role in plant community assembly. Mechanistic models of community assembly state that the assemblage of species in a local community is controlled by environment filters operating on functional traits. We measured within- and among-species variation of SLA, and environmental conditions in a tropical cloud forest to explore how variation in this functional trait contributes to community assembly. SLA variation at the species level was also decomposed into alpha (within assemblage variation), and beta (across assemblage variation) values. SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance (approximated using plant height) within the three study sites, and differed among the three sites both for within- and among-species comparisons. Mean plot SLA, accounting for both within and among species across the three sites, increased significantly in relation to air temperature but not local photosynthetic photon flux density and soil total phosphorus. Alpha SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance within the three sites and beta SLA differed among the three sites. Our results clearly demonstrate that light and air temperature are key environmental factors involved in organizing plant species within and among communities in tropical cloud forests. The strong relationship between both intra- and interspecific variation in SLA and environmental conditions strongly confirms the role of trait variation in the assembly of plant species in tropical cloud forest communities via environment filtering related to light availability and air temperature.},

abstract = {1 We studied stratification of tree species by analysing the allometry and demography of 14 abundant species in a warm-temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, southern Japan. 2 We regressed relationships between trunk diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) and top height of trees using an expanded allometry which incorporates an upper limit to height. As trees grew up towards the canopy, individuals with the same d.b.h. were taller if they came from species with larger maximum height. This appeared to reflect a trade-off between height growth and lateral growth of crowns. Two canopy dominants continued to gain in d.b.h. after they had reached the canopy, while their height remained almost constant. 3 We examined size-specific patterns of relative growth rate of d.b.h. from a decade of field censuses. By fitting a Gompertz-type growth curve to size-specific growth of individual trees, we derived a projected potential maximum size for each species. The projected maximum size (both d.b.h. and height) was similar to the observed value for most species. Three canopy species exhibited larger projected maximum d.b.h. than observed values; the difference seemed to be due to mortality during the long period that each of these species resides in the canopy. 4 Understorey species recruited equally well as larger-growing species amongst the 14 studied species, although their tree mass increments per unit time were smaller. This suggests that understorey species have more effective recruiting capacity relative to vegetative growth.},

abstract = {A key goal of functional ecology is identifying relationships between species traits and environmental conditions. Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a "fast" life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a "slow" life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.},

abstract = {Growth performance was assessed for a diverse suite of canopy and emergent tree species in a lowland neotropical rain forest (the La Selva Biological Station, north-eastern Costa Rica). Species were evaluated based on annual diameter measurements of large samples of individuals in all post-seedling size classes, over a 12-yr period. The study species were seven non-pioneers (Minquartia guianensis, Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Simarouba amara, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, and Hyeronima alchorneoides) and two pioneers (Cecropia obtusifolia and C. insignis). For each species, inherent growth capacity through ontogeny was estimated as the mean of the five largest annual increments (from different individuals) in each juvenile and adult size class. At all tree sizes, species differed highly significantly in this measure. In the small sapling sizes ($\le$4-cm diameter), the two pioneers showed markedly higher maximum growth than all the non-pioneers, in line with current understanding. This growth advantage, however, was quickly lost with increasing tree size. For eight of the nine species, the onto genetic patterns of maximal growth closely corresponded to species groupings previously based on juvenile microsites (forest stage, light levels). Average growth rates, however, which are the combined result of environmental and biotic factors, did not show this correspondence. The groups based on microsite occupancy and growth potential provide a starting point for treating the great numbers of species of tropical rain forest trees as many fewer functional types, a sine qua non for modeling these complex forests. The exceptional growth capacity of one of our focal non-pioneer species (Simarouba) suggests that it represents a hitherto unrecognized functional type among tropical rain forest trees. The data from this long-term study indicate that several assumptions of current forest-dynamics models are not applicable to trees of this biome. For most species (1) diameter growth during regeneration was not correlated with tree size; (2) adult sizes were not characterized by a constant maximal basal-area increment; and (3) growth capacity did not decline toward zero as trees approached maximum size. Evaluation of overall increment distributions revealed a broad adult size range of exclusively high growth in the emergent Hymenolobium; for two additional species, sectors of the adult size range showed an absence of very low or negative growth. At most sizes, however, all nine species displayed the full range of growth increments, from slightly negative to observed maxima. Describing the performance of tropical rain forest canopy trees will require similar analysis of growth data obtained from many individuals and intervals, and stratified across juvenile and adult life stages. More realistic forest-dynamics models will depend on such evaluations of many tree species, in diverse tropical rain forests. Such models are greatly needed, both for designing management for this biome and for predicting its responses to changing climate and atmospheric conditions.},

abstract = {Linking functional traits to plant growth is critical for scaling attributes of organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems and for understanding how selection shapes integrated botanical phenotypes. However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate, recent work on functional trait spectra, and metabolic scaling theory, here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.},

abstract = {Close correlations between specific leaf area (SLA) and relative growth rate (RGR) have been reported in many studies. However, theoretically, SLA by itself has small net positive effect on RGR because any increase in SLA inevitably causes a decrease in area-based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNCa), another RGR component. It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNCa. Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis. SLA varied 1.9-fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a47% decrease in LNCa along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9-fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNCa. Consequently, LNCa values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA-RGR relationship was achieved. These results highlight the importance of leaf-root interactions in understanding interspecific differences in RGR.},

abstract = {Foliar anatomy and morphology are strongly related to physiological performance; therefore, phenotypic plasticity in leaves to variations in environmental conditions, such as irradiance and soil moisture availability, can be related to growth rate and survivorship, mainly during critical growth phases, such as establishment. The aim of this work was to analyze changes in the foliar internal anatomy (tissue proportions and cell dimensions) and external morphology (leaf length, width and area) of Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser seedlings growing in a greenhouse under controlled irradiance (three levels) and soil moisture (two levels) during one growing season (measured three times), and to relate them to physiological traits. Three irradiance levels (4, 26 and 64% of the natural incident light) and two soil moisture levels (40 and 80% soil capacity) were evaluated during November, January and March. Internal foliar anatomy of seedlings was analyzed using digital photographs of histological cuttings, while leaf gross morphology was measured using digital calipers and image analysis software. Most internal anatomical variables presented significant differences under different irradiance levels during the growing season, but differences were not detected between soil moisture levels. Palisade parenchyma was the tissue most sensitive to irradiance levels, and high irradiance levels (64% natural incident light) produced greater values in most of the internal anatomical variables than lower irradiance levels (4-24% natural incident light). Complementarily, larger leaves were observed in medium and low irradiance levels, as well as under low soil moisture levels (40% soil capacity). The relationship of main results with some eco-physiological traits was discussed. Foliar internal anatomical and external morphological plasticity allows quick acclimation of seedlings to environmental changes (e.g., during harvesting). These results can be used to propose new forest practices that consider soil moisture and light availability changes to maintain high physiological performance of seedlings.},

abstract = {The comparative phenotypic plasticity of 16 species of tropical rainforest shrubs (genus Psychotria, Rubiaceae) was investigated by growing plants in three light environments on Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Panama). The three light environments gave daily photon flux densities (PPFD) similar to the natural light gradient from shaded forest understory to small and large canopy gaps. Six of the species are principally found in gaps or forest edge environments, whereas the other ten species are principally found in shaded understories. Interactions between light treatment and species resulted in unpredictable mean phenotypic expression across light treatments. Shoot relative growth rates (RGR) were similar for understory and gap species in the low light treatment. Gap species had significantly greater shoot RGR in the intermediate light treatment than in the high light treatment. Mean plasticity was significantly lower for morphological variables when compared to physiological variables, while variation in plasticity was significantly greater for structural variables. Significant differences between gap and understory species were found in the plasticity of six out of the seven variables. The mean phenotypic plasticity of the seven variables was significantly greater for gap than for understory species. The high plasticity of gap species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity. The species exhibited a wide range of leaf longevities, from four to 29 months, with gap species having, on average, shorter leaf life-span than understory species. Mean phenotypic plasticity decreased with increasing leaf longevity. Selection for greater plasticity may be stronger in the gap species because gaps exhibit a relatively predictable decrease in PPFD for which plasticity could be adaptive. While we have found a significant correlation between phenotypic plasticity and habitat affiliation, phylogeny (subgenus ascription) was not correlated with plasticity or with plant performance in any given PPFD treatment, reinforcing the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity has evolved through natural selection in this diverse genus.},

abstract = {A central concept in forest ecology is that differences in the growth rates and shade tolerances of tree species determine patterns of secondary succession. The most shade-tolerant tree species are the competitive dominants in late-successional forests, while species with fast growth rates persist through rapid establishment after disturbance. There is ample support for niche differentiation along the shade-tolerance axis, at least for temperate forests, but less thought has been given to the range of shade tolerances and growth rates encountered within a community and to how it might vary along environmental gradients. We hypothesized that a wider range of growth rates and shade tolerances are found on nutrient-rich soils, because such soils not only support fast-growing species with high metabolic rates, but also species capable of tolerating the very deep shade cast by forest canopies growing where nutrients are plentiful. We test our hypothesis by quantifying light transmission through two neighbouring forests in southern New Zealand, one on phosphorus-rich alluvial soil and one on phosphorus-depleted marine-terrace soil, and comparing the growth rates of saplings on these contrasting sites. Less light was transmitted to the forest floor on alluvial sites than on marine terraces (2.5% vs. 7.5% daylight, on average) and neighbourhood analyses within mapped stands indicated that large-leaved subcanopy species were responsible for intercepting that extra light. Sapling growth was strongly inhibited by shade in the understorey of the alluvial forests, but was less inhibited under the terrace forests. Fast-growing subcanopy species were common on the alluvial sites and these species had characteristically soft leaves and high foliar-nutrient concentrations. Slow-growing shade-tolerant species were also abundant on these sites. Therefore, the interspecific variance in growth rates was greater on nutrient-rich sites, supporting our hypothesis of a greater range of shade tolerance niches on better soils. Of the five species found on both forest sites, all five had greater high-light growth rate on the alluvial sites. Synthesis: A wider range of growth rates was observed in the nutrient-rich forests. This wider range may translate into a greater number of shade tolerance niches and thereby provides an explanation for the greater numbers of species commonly found on nutrient-rich soils when compared with neighbouring nutrient-poor sites.},

The following examines the evolutionary ecology of wood density using a large database for seed plants. In particular, we focused on the geographic and phylogenetic variation in wood density for both gymnosperms and angiosperms. A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community-wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.},

abstract = {Species differ regarding their drought tolerance and individuals of a given species can modify their morphology and physiology in response to drought. However, since evolutionary and ecological selective pressures differ, individual and interspecific responses to drought might not match. We determined summer survival and a number of ecophysiological variables in two factorial experiments with seedlings of eleven tree species present in Mediterranean ecosystems, grown under slowly imposed water stress and control conditions. Plants experiencing drought exhibited reduced growth, low specific leaf area, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rate when compared to the controls, and species-specific drought tolerance was associated with an analogous set of trait values. However, while species with high leaf area ratio and shoot-root ratio exhibited greater drought tolerance, drought induced the reversed response within species. Contrary to expectations, water use efficiency was lower in drought-tolerant species and decreased in water-stressed individuals compared to the control plants. There was a distinctive phylogenetic signal in the functional grouping of species, with oaks, pines, and other genera being clearly different from each other in their drought tolerance and in their functional responses to drought. However, all relationships between ecophysiological variables and drought tolerance were significant after accounting for phylogenetic effects, with the exception of the relationship between drought tolerance and photochemical efficiency. Our results show that drought tolerance is not achieved by a single combination of trait values, and that even though evolutionary processes and individual responses tend to render similar results in terms of functional traits associated with drought, they do not necessarily match.},

abstract = {1. A growth analysis was conducted on seven annual/perennial pairs of grasses (six congeneric and one pair taken at random) grown in a hydroponic culture system under constant, productive conditions, in order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the higher relative growth rate (RGR) of annuals as compared to perennials. 2. All the production parameters (RGR, relative leaf production rate, unit leaf rates), were higher in annuals than in perennials. There were very few differences between the two life forms in biomass allocation to the different organs (except a higher allocation to sheaths in perennials). The specific leaf areas and the leaf area ratios were higher in annuals, whereas the dry-weight: fresh-weight ratios of all the organs were higher in perennials. These differences between annuals and perennials were almost systematic when the comparisons were made within a given genus, but not when they were made between annuals and perennials in different genera. 3. The wide range of RGR obtained for the 14 species also permitted general relationships between RGR and the various components of growth to be discussed. RGR was significantly correlated with: (i) unit leaf rate, (ii) specific leaf area, (iii) leaf area ratio, (iv) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of the whole plant, and (v) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of roots. Surprisingly, RGR was not correlated with any of the biomass allocation parameters. The single factor that best explained the differences in RGR was the specific leaf area. 4. If, as has been hypothesized elsewhere, the annual life form is derived from the perennial one, the results presented here suggest that the same morphological changes have occurred repeatedly in different genera. It is argued that these changes, which are probably correlated with differences in anatomical features, mainly affect the specific (i.e. per unit weight or area) uptake capacities of the plant organs, leading to the higher seedling growth rate observed in annuals.},

abstract = {Patterns of above- and below-ground biomass allocation in seedlings of nine common cloud forest (CF) tree species of western Mexico were examined under varying controlled light conditions using artificial shade houses. We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47\{\&}\{\#}xa0;cm2\{\&}\{\#}xa0;g{\textminus}1). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P\{\&}\{\#}xa0;\{\&}lt;\{\&}\{\#}xa0;0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P\{\&}\{\#}xa0;\{\&}lt;\{\&}\{\#}xa0;0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly. Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of morphological traits in this variation.},

abstract = {Convergence in interspecific leaf trait relationships across diverse taxonomic groups and biomes would have important evolutionary and ecological implications. Such convergence has been hypothesized to result from trade-offs that limit the combination of plant traits for any species. Here we address this issue by testing for biome differences in the slope and intercept of interspecific relationships among leaf traits: longevity, net photosynthetic capacity (A<sub>max</sub>) leaf diffusive conductance (G<sub>s</sub>) specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen (N) status, for more than 100 species in six distinct biomes of the Americas. The six biomes were: alpine tundra-subalpine forest ecotone, cold temperate forest-prairie ecotone, montane cool temperate forest, desert shrubland, subtropical forest, and tropical rain forest. Despite large differences in climate and evolutionary history, in all biomes mass-based leaf N (N<sub>mass</sub>), SLA, G<sub>s</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> were positively related to one another and decreased with increasing leaf life span. The relationships between pairs of leaf traits exhibited similar slopes among biomes, suggesting a predictable set of scaling relationships among key leaf morphological, chemical, and metabolic traits that are replicated globally among terrestrial ecosystems regardless of biome or vegetation type. However, the intercept (i.e., the overall elevation of regression lines) of relationships between pairs of leaf traits usually differed among biomes. With increasing aridity across sites, species had greater A<sub>max</sub> for a given level of G<sub>s</sub> and lower SLA for any given leaf life span. Using principal components analysis, most variation among species was explained by an axis related to mass-based leaf traits (A<sub>max</sub>, N, and SLA) while a second axis reflected climate, G<sub>s</sub>, and other area-based leaf traits.},

Trees in treatment I(0) had the greatest mean daily first-order shoot growth rates, and trees in treatment I(3) had the lowest shoot growth rates. Because leaf production rate (apparent plastochron) of first-order shoots was unaffected by treatment, differences in shoot length were due to differences in internode extension and not to the number of internodes. Trees in treatment I(0) had a greater number of second-order shoot axes than trees in treatment I(1) or I(3). Furthermore, an increase in the rate of growth of the first-order shoot axis was associated with an increased tendency for branching (i.e., the development of sylleptic second-order shoots). Increased leaf length was also associated with more frequent watering. Trees in treatment I(0) had the greatest root lengths and dry weights, and this was attributed to a greater number of first-and second-order (lateral) root axes compared with trees in the I(1) and I(3) treatments. The extension rate and apical diameter of first-order roots were reduced by the I(3) treatment. The density of second-order roots along primary root axes was not affected by any of the treatments.},

abstract = {Slow-growing juveniles of shade-tolerant plant species are predicted to have tough leaves because of the high cost of leaf replacement in shade relative to potential carbon gain. We assessed the degree of correlated evolution among eight traits associated with leaf toughness and the relationships of those traits with the growth and mortality rates of 197 tree and shrub species from the understory of the 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Path analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts revealed that leaves attained material toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture area) through increases in tissue density, percent cellulose per unit dry mass, and vein fracture toughness. Lamina density and cellulose content evolved independently and thus represent different paths to material toughness. Structural toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture length) depended on material toughness and lamina thickness. Mortality rates of individuals 1-10 cm in stem diameter were negatively correlated with material toughness and lamina density but were independent of structural toughness and cell wall fiber contents. Leaf toughness traits were uncorrelated with relative growth rates. Results imply that material toughness enhances resistance to natural enemies, which increases survival and offsets the biomass allocation cost of producing tough leaves in the shaded understory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous work has shown that the entire photosynthetic light response curve, based on both Mitscherlich and Michaelis-Menten functions, could be predicted in an interspecific context through allometric relations linking the parameters of these functions to two static leaf traits: leaf nitrogen (N) content and leaf mass per area (LMA). This paper describes to what extent these allometric relations are robust to changes in soil fertility and the growth irradiance of the plants. METHODS: Plants of 25 herbaceous species were grown under controlled conditions in factorial combinations of low/high soil fertility and low/high growth irradiance. Net photosynthetic rates per unit dry mass were measured at light intensities ranging from 0 to 700 {\textmu}mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). KEY RESULTS: The differing growth environments induced large changes in N, LMA and in each of the parameter estimates of the Mitscherlich and Michaelis-Menten functions. However, the differing growth environments induced only small (although significant) changes in the allometric relationships linking N and LMA to the parameters of the two functions. As a result, 88 % (Mitcherlich) and 89 % (Michaelis-Menten) of the observed net photosynthetic rates over the full range of light intensities (0-700 {\textmu}mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR) and across all four growth environments could be predicted using only N and LMA using the same allometric relations. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility of predicting net photosynthetic rates in nature across species over the full range of light intensities using readily available data.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the evolutionary dynamics of delayed maturation in semelparous individuals. We model this in a two-stage clonally reproducing population subject to density-dependent fertility. The population dynamical model allows multiple {\textemdash} cyclic and/or chaotic {\textemdash} attractors, thus allowing us to illustrate how (i) evolutionary stability is primarily a property of a population dynamical system as a whole, and (ii) that the evolutionary stability of a demographic strategy by necessity derives from the evolutionary stability of the stationary population dynamical systems it can engender, i.e., its associated population dynamical attractors. Our approach is based on numerically estimating invasion exponents or {\textquotedblleft}mutant fitnesses{\textquotedblright}. The invasion exponent is defined as the theoretical long-term average relative growth rate of a population of mutants in the stationary environment defined by a resident population system. For some combinations of resident and mutant trait values, we have to consider multi-valued invasion exponents, which makes the evolutionary argument more complicated (and more interesting) than is usually envisaged. Multi-valuedness occurs (i) when more than one attractor is associated with the values of the residents' demographic parameters, or (ii) when the setting of the mutant parameters makes the descendants of a single mutant reproduce exclusively either in even or in odd years, so that a mutant population is affected by either subsequence of the fluctuating resident densities only. Non-equilibrium population dynamics or random environmental noise selects for strategists with a non-zero probability to delay maturation. When there is an evolutionarily attracting pair of such a strategy and a population dynamical attractor engendered by it, this delaying probability is a Continuously Stable Strategy, that is an Evolutionarily Unbeatable Strategy which is also Stable in a long term evolutionary sense. Population dynamical coexistence of delaying and non-delaying strategists is possible with non-equilibrium dynamics, but adding random environmental noise to the model destroys this coexistence. Adding random noise also shifts the CSS towards a higher probability of delaying maturation.},

The present study examines analogous evolutionary responses to vertical gradients in light availability, through an analysis of patterns of photosynthetic variation among late-successional tropical tree species that differ in adult stature. Larger statured tree species are expected to have higher values for light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) as adults, due to the inevitable gradient in light availability through the canopy. However, we argue that larger statured species should also show a higher Amax, and other {\textquotedblleft}sun-plant{\textquotedblright} characteristics, as saplings under relatively uniform low light conditions in the forest understory.

A database was compiled, comprising data for hundreds to thousands of species for the core 'leaf economics' traits leaf lifespan, leaf mass per area, photosynthetic capacity, dark respiration, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, as well as leaf potassium, photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), and leaf N : P ratio. While mean trait values differed between plant functional types, the range found within groups was often larger than differences among them. Future vegetation-climate models could incorporate this knowledge. The core leaf traits were intercorrelated, both globally and within plant functional types, forming a 'leaf economics spectrum'. While these relationships are very general, they are not universal, as significant heterogeneity exists between relationships fitted to individual sites. Much, but not all, heterogeneity can be explained by variation in sample size alone. PNUE can also be considered as part of this trait spectrum, whereas leaf K and N : P ratios are only loosely related.},

We grew sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.; SO) seedlings, budded trees of 'Salustiano' orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck; SAO) on SO, 'Verna' lemon (Citrus limon L. Burm. f; VL/SO) and interstock trees (VL/SAO/SO) in pots of sand watered with nutrient solution containing 5 (control) or 50 mM NaCl (saline treatment) for 12 weeks. Plants were harvested in six successive harvests and time trends in relative growth rate (RGR) and its components were estimated by fitting a Richards function regression to the harvest data. The VL/SAO/SO trees in saline conditions had higher mean RGR than VL/SO trees in control conditions. Increases in both net assimilation rate on a leaf mass basis (NARw) and leaf mass fraction (LMF) contributed equally to a twofold increase in RGR of VL/SAO/SO trees in saline conditions. In control conditions, the increase in RGR caused by the interstock had growth response coefficients of GRC(NARw) = 0.20 and GRC(LMF) = 0.80. Structural modifications-specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and LMF-had a slight influence on the salt-induced changes in RGR, whereas NARw had a large influence. Salinity decreased root mass fraction (RMF) and increased stem mass fraction (SMF). In contrast, the interstock decreased SMF and increased LMF and RMF. The VL/SAO/SO trees had the highest RMF and proportionally higher Cl- and Na+ allocations in roots than the other plant types. In saline conditions, reductions in leaf ion transport rate and dilution of imported ions by foliar growth nearly halved ion accumulations in leaves of VL/SAO/SO trees.},

As woody species often have larger seeds and RGR is negatively correlated with seed mass, it is entirely possible the lower RGRs observed in woody species is a consequence of having larger seeds rather than different growth strategies. Using a synthesis of the published literature, we explored the relationship between RGR and growth form, accounting for the effects of seed mass and study-specific effects (e.g. duration of study and pot volume), using a mixed-effects model. The model showed that herbaceous species do indeed have higher RGRs than woody species, and that the difference was independent of seed mass, thus at all seed masses, herbaceous species on average grow faster than woody ones.},

abstract = {1 Responses to the addition of P and Mg are described for eight species of Shorea section Doona (Dipterocarpaceae) which vary in their adult distribution across a topographic/soils gradient at Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Sri Lanka. 2 All combinations of the two nutrients resulted in increased dry mass yield, seedling height and leaf number after 24 months for seedlings of these species growing in pots of soil taken from a nearby Pinus plantation compared to a control which did not receive nutrients. In the presence of P, dry mass yield, leaf number and lateral root ratio declined in response to increasing Mg. In the presence of Mg, seedling height and stem mass ratio increased in response to increasing P. 3 After 24 months maximum dry mass yield in response to nutrient addition was greater for the four species which occur on more nutrient-rich soils in the field. Maximum percentage increase in dry mass in response to nutrient addition was negatively correlated with mean dry mass of unfertilized seedlings, but the relationship did not discriminate between species according to adult distribution across the catena. 4 There was no relation between seedling root mass ratio (RMR) or phenotypic plasticity in seedling RMR and adult distribution in relation to nutrient supply. 5 In Shorea section Doona, trade-offs between seedling `responsiveness' and `tolerance' to nutrient supply, in terms of either growth or dry mass allocation, are not powerful determinants of differences in adult distribution in relation to nutrient supply. Differential dry mass yield in response to nutrient addition was determined by differences in seed size and seedling relative growth rates under the experimental conditions, as well as the degree of response to nutrient addition. Response to nutrient addition may be constrained by seedling characteristics relating to variation in irradiance and water availability.},

The results underlined that the ratio RL/PN of the considered species ranged from 0.15~{\textpm}~0.08 (in winter) to 1.32~{\textpm}~0.80 (in summer). Variations of RL and PN during the year were attested by the PCA which was carried out using leaf physiological and morphological traits of the considered species. In particular, Cistus incanus having the highest mean yearly PN and RL rates and low leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf tissue density (LTD), was furthest from the other species emphasizing its drought semi-deciduous habitus, the highest photosynthetic capability in favorable conditions (spring), but low tolerance to drought. Erica multiflora and Rosmarinus officinalis were characterized by the highest LMA and LTD, low PN rates in drought and the lowest PN ones in spring. Erica arborea, Pistacia lentiscus, Phillyrea latifolia and Quercus ilex had the highest drought tolerance. Arbutus unedo and Smilax aspera were close to this group despite lower RL rates during the year. The xeromorphic leaves of the considered evergreen species (i.e. high LMA and LTD) favor carbon gain profits over transpiration losses during drought, nevertheless, the high construction cost of these leaf type justifies the relatively high RL rates.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

abstract = {Published information about the effects of ozone on plants and ecosystems is synthesized into a conceptual model to explain the response of evergreen conifers, deciduous hardwoods and agricultural crops to ambient levels of ozone pollution. The effects of ozone on carbon balance and growth of individual plants can be quantified on the basis of concentration, external dose (concentration x duration of exposure), or uptake. For an equivalent dose within a single growing season, agricultural crops are the most sensitive to ozone, with hardwoods intermediate and conifers least sensitive. In contrast, all species display a similar decline in photosynthesis and growth in response to equivalent total uptake or uptake per leaf life span, with trees somewhat less sensitive than agricultural crops on a calendar time scale, but slightly more sensitive on a relative (leaf life span) time scale. Among species, differences in ozone uptake and response can be predicted from differences in the inherent leaf diffusive conductance.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that plant invasions can occur in resource-poor and relatively undisturbed habitats. It is, therefore, important to investigate whether and how life-history traits of species invasive in such habitats differ from those of species that are only invasive in disturbed and resource rich habitats. We compared the growth of seedlings of native and invasive tree species from nutrient-poor secondary forests in the tropical Seychelles. We hypothesised that the relative performance of the two groups would change predictably along resource gradients, with native species performing better at low levels of resource availability and invasive species performing better at higher levels. To test this hypothesis, we performed a common garden experiment using seedlings of six invasive and seven native tree species grown under three levels of light (65, 11 and 3.5% of ambient light) and two of nutrients (low and high). Due to large variation among species, differences in growth rates (RGR) were not significant among seedlings of the native and the invasive species. However, seedlings of the invasive species showed higher specific leaf areas (SLA) and higher leaf nutrient contents than seedlings of the native species. They also exhibited greater plasticity in biomass and nutrient allocation (i.e., greater plasticity in LAR, RSR and leaf nutrient contents) in response to varying resource availability. However, differences between the mean values of these parameters were generally small compared with variation within groups. We conclude that successful invaders on nutrient-poor soils in the Seychelles are either stress-tolerant, possessing growth traits similar to those of the native species, or fast-growing but adapted to nutrient-poor soils. In contrast, the more typical, fast-growing alien species with no particular adaptations to nutrient-poor soils seem to be restricted to relative nutrient-rich sites in the lowlands. The finding{\textemdash}that some introduced species thrive in resource-poor habitats{\textemdash}suggests that undisturbed habitats with low resource availability may be less resistant to plant invasions than was previously supposed.},

abstract = {The growth rates and patterns of above-ground biomass allocation were determined for saplings of nine species of a wet tropical forest in Costa Rica. Relative growth rate and allocation were calculated by remeasuring the dimensions of forest-grown saplings and using biomass-dimension relationships derived from harvested saplings to convert linear dimensions to biomass estimates. The light environment of each sapling was characterized in terms of direct and indirect site factors calculated from hemispherical `fisheye' photographs of the canopy. Relative growth rate (RGR) was significantly correlated with both direct and indirect site factors. A significant negative correlation was found between ln(% leaf allocation) and RGR for six species, but no such correlation occurred for the three species most highly associated with canopy gaps. Thus, shade-tolerant saplings shift most of their above-ground growth to leaf replacement when heavily shaded, while gap-associated species allocate about 2/3 of above-ground growth to the stem and branches under all measured conditions. This differential plasticity in leaf vs wood allocation may be an important factor in determining the shade tolerance and successional status of woody species.},

In contrast, size-standardized growth rate or {SGR} factors out these size effects. Differences in {SGR} can thus only be due to differences in morphology, allocation, or physiology. We used nonlinear regression to calculate {SGR} for comparison with {RGR} for 10 groups of species spanning a wide range of life forms. We found that {RGR} was negatively correlated with seed mass in nearly all groups, but the relationship between {SGR} and seed mass was highly variable. We conclude that small-seeded species only sometimes possess additional adaptations for rapid growth over and above their general size advantage.},

abstract = {1. The relationship between seedling potential relative growth rate RGR and seed mass was investigated by growing in the glasshouse 26 species selected to form 13 phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). The two species in each PIC diverged at least 10-fold in seed mass and each PIC represented a phylogenetic branching independent of the other PICs in the study. 2. During the process of deployment following germination, seedlings undergo an initial dry mass decline before autographic growth overtakes respiration and mass begins to increase exponentially. This initial decline tended to be earlier and deeper in the smaller-seeded species of each PIC. Mass began to increase earlier in the smaller-seeded species in eight of the 13 PICs, there being no difference in the other five; the percentage mass decline from day 0 to day 2 was significantly greater in the smaller-seeded species in four of the 13 PICs, almost significantly greater in two further PICs and not different in seven PICs. 3. In all species exponential growth was under way by day 6 and continued through day 40. RGR was significantly different between the members of 12 of the 13 PICs. In 10 of these the larger-seeded member had slower RGR, vs the reverse relationship in two PICs, and there was also an overall negative correlation between seed mass and RGR considered across all 26 species. Thus the association reported in several previous studies between larger seed mass and slower potential seedling RGR occurs repeatedly within genera and families, as well as across older divergences between families and orders. 4. RGR differences within PICs were most often owing to differences in net assimilation rate (leaf mass basis) NARw, rather than to differences in allocation to leaf mass as a proportion of whole plant mass. 5. There were interesting unexplained patterns in the relationship of apical meristem volumes, measured at day 26, to seed mass. Root meristems were larger in the larger-seeded species in nine of 13 PICs (as perhaps might be expected, though there was little overall relationship between seed mass and meristem volume) but shoot meristems were larger in the smaller-seeded species in 11 of 13 PICs. Differences in meristem volume within PICs were considerable, often 10-fold.},

abstract = {Wood specific gravity (WSG) is a strong predictor of tree performance across environmental gradients. Yet it remains unclear how anatomical elements linked to different wood functions contribute to variation in WSG in branches and roots across tropical forests. We examined WSG and wood anatomy in white sand, clay terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in French Guiana, spanning broad environmental gradients found throughout Amazonia. We measured 15 traits relating to branches and small woody roots in 113 species representing the 15 most abundant species in each habitat and representative species from seven monophyletic lineages occurring in all habitats. Fiber traits appear to be major determinants of WSG, independent of vessel traits, in branches and roots. Fiber traits and branch and root WSG increased from seasonally flooded species to clay terra firme species and lastly to white sand species. Branch and root wood traits were strongly phylogenetically constrained. Lineages differed in wood design, but exhibited similar variation in wood structure across habitats. We conclude that tropical trees can invest differently in support and transport to respond to environmental conditions. Wind disturbance and drought stress represent significant filters driving tree distribution of Amazonian forests; hence we suggest that biophysical explanations should receive more attention.},

abstract = {Plant growth plays a key role in the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere, and there have been substantial efforts to understand why growth varies among species. To this end, a large number of experimental analyses have been undertaken; however, the emergent patterns between growth rate and its components are often contradictory. We believe that these conflicting results are a consequence of the way growth is measured. Growth is typically characterized by relative growth rate ({RGR);} however, {RGR} often declines as organisms get larger, making it difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome this problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed-effects models so that {RGR} can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily implemented methods for doing this. We then present new methods for analyzing the traditional components of {RGR} that explicitly allow for the fact that is the sum of its components. These methods provide an exact decomposition of the variance in . Finally, we use simple analytical and simulation approaches to explore the effect of size variation on growth and its components and show that the relative importance of the components of {RGR} is influenced by the extent to which analyses standardize for plant size.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lianas are expected to differ from trees in their growth strategies. As a result these two groups of woody species will have different spatial distributions: lianas are more common in high light environments. This study determines the differences in growth patterns, biomass allocation and leaf traits in five closely related liana and tree species of the genus Bauhinia. METHODS: Seedlings of two light-demanding lianas (Bauhinia tenuiflora and B. claviflora), one shade-tolerant liana (B. aurea), and two light-demanding trees (B. purpurea and B. monandra) were grown in a shadehouse at 25% of full sunlight. A range of physiological, morphological and biomass parameters at the leaf and whole plant level were compared among these five species. KEY RESULTS: The two light-demanding liana species had higher relative growth rate (RGR), allocated more biomass to leaf production [higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and higher leaf area ratio (LAR)] and stem mass fraction (SMF), and less biomass to the roots [root mass fraction (RMF)] than the two tree species. The shade-tolerant liana had the lowest RGR of all five species, and had a higher RMF, lower SMF and similar LMF than the two light-demanding liana species. The two light-demanding lianas had lower photosynthetic rates per unit area (A(area)) and similar photosynthetic rates per unit mass (A(mass)) than the trees. Across species, RGR was positively related to SLA, but not to LAR and A(area). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the faster growth of light-demanding lianas compared with light-demanding trees is based on morphological parameters (SLA, LMF and LAR), and cannot be attributed to higher photosynthetic rates at the leaf level. The shade-tolerant liana exhibited a slow-growth strategy, compared with the light-demanding species.},

abstract = {1. The development of simple predictors of tree growth is important in understanding forest dynamics. For this purpose, tree height, crown width in two perpendicular directions, trunk diameter at 1.3 m height (d.b.h.) and crown illumination index (CI) were determined for 727 pole-sized trees (8-20 cm d.b.h.) of 21 species, on forest dynamics plots at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia and Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. A light-interception index (LI = A(cr)CI(2), where A(cr) is crown area) was calculated for each tree, and wood density (stem wood dry mass/fresh volume) was estimated for each species from reported values. 2. Diameter growth rates were linearly correlated with LI (mean per species r(2) = 0.45, excluding substantially damaged and vine-covered trees). 3. Among trees of all species, diameter growth rate was highly correlated with LI/wood density. 4. Mean growth rate per species varied 10-fold among the study species, but increased linearly with mean LI/wood density ratio (r(2) = 0.78), consistent with the previous pattern. 5. Thus much of the variability in tree growth rates, both within and among species, can be accounted for by the simple mechanistic assumption that, within a given size class, growth is proportional to light interception/wood density.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many tropical forest tree species delay greening their leaves until full expansion. This strategy is thought to provide newly flushing leaves with protection against damage by herbivores by keeping young leaves devoid of nutritive value. Because young leaves suffer the greatest predation from invertebrate herbivores, delayed greening could prevent costly tissue loss. Many species that delay greening also produce anthocyanin pigments in their new leaves, giving them a reddish tint. These anthocyanins may be fungicidal, protect leaves against UV damage or make leaves cryptic to herbivores blind to the red part of the spectrum. METHODS: A comprehensive survey was undertaken of seedlings, saplings and mature trees in two diverse tropical forests: a rain forest in western Amazonia (Yasun{\'\i} National Park, Ecuador) and a deciduous forest in Central America (Barro Colorado Island, Panam{\'a}). A test was made of whether individuals and species with delayed greening or red-coloured young leaves showed lower mortality or higher relative growth rates than species that did not. KEY RESULTS: At both Yasun{\'\i} and Barro Colorado Island, species with delayed greening or red young leaves comprised significant proportions of the seedling and tree communities. At both sites, significantly lower mortality was found in seedlings and trees with delayed greening and red-coloured young leaves. While there was little effect of leaf colour on the production of new leaves of seedlings, diameter relative growth rates of small trees were lower in species with delayed greening and red-coloured young leaves than in species with regular green leaves, and this effect remained when the trade-off between mortality and growth was accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: Herbivores exert strong selection pressure on seedlings for the expression of defence traits. A delayed greening or red-coloured young leaf strategy in seedlings appears to be associated with higher survival for a given growth rate, and may thus influence the species composition of later life stages.},

abstract = {* Shade tolerance can be defined as the light level at which plants can survive and possibly grow. This light level is referred to as the whole-plant light compensation point (LCP). The LCP depends on multiple leaf and architectural traits. We are still uncertain how often interspecific trait differences allow species to specialize for separate light niches, as observed between shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. Alternatively, trait plasticity may allow many species to grow in similar light conditions. * We measured leaf and architectural traits of up to 1.5-year-old seedlings of 15 sympatric Psychotria shrub species grown at three light levels. We used a 3D plant model to estimate the impacts of leaf traits, architectural traits and plant size on the whole-plant light compensation point (LCPplant). Plant growth rates were estimated from destructive harvests and allometric relationships. * At lower light levels, plants of all species achieved a lower leaf light compensation point (LCPleaf). The light interception efficiency (LIE), an index of self-shading, decreased with increasing plant size and was therefore lower in high-light treatments where plants grew more rapidly. When corrected for size, LIE was lower in the low-light treatment, possibly as a result of lower investments in woody support. Species did not show trade-offs in growth under low- and high-light conditions, because species with the greatest plasticity in LCPplant and underlying traits (LCPleaf and LIE) achieved the highest growth rates at lower light levels. * Synthesis. The interspecific differences in LCPplant did not result in a growth or survival trade-off between low- and high-light conditions. Instead, these differences were more than offset by the greater plasticity in LCPplant in some species, which was driven by greater plasticity in both leaves and architecture. The most plastic species achieved the fastest growth at different light levels. The results show that plasticity largely neutralizes the separation of light niches amongst species in this forest understorey genus and imply that differential preferences of species for either gaps or forest understorey occur in later life phases or are driven by other stress factors than low light alone.},

abstract = {To assess the diversity of tropical tree life histories, a conceptual framework is needed to guide quantitative comparative study of many species. We propose one such framework, which focuses on long-term performance through ontogeny and over the natural range of microsites. For 6 yr we annually evaluated survival, growth, and microsite conditions of six non-pioneer tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species were: Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, Hyeronima alchorneoides (all emergents), and Minquartia guianensis (a canopy species). The study was based on long-term measurement of individuals from all post-seedling size classes. Trees were sampled from 150 ha of primary forest spanning several watersheds and soil types. To evaluate individuals' microsites we recorded the number of overtopping crowns, forest phase (gap, building, mature), and crown illumination index (an estimate of the tree's light environment). For comparison, we also evaluated the microsites of three species that have been categorized as pioneers (Cecropia insignis, C. obtusifolia) or high-light demanders (Simarouba amara). For the six species of non-pioneers, mortality rates declined with increasing juvenile size class. As a group, these emergent and canopy trees showed a much lower exponential annual mortality rate (0.44%/yr at >10 cm diameter) than has been found for the La Selva forest as a whole. Growth rates increased with juvenile size class for all six species. As adults (trees >30 cm in diameter), all five emergent species showed substantial annual diameter increments (medians of 5-14 mm/yr). Small saplings and adults of all species had significant year-to-year variation in diameter growth, with much greater growth occurring in the year of lowest rainfall. Passage time analysis suggests that all six species require >150 yr for growth from small saplings to the canopy. Evaluation of all nine species revealed four patterns of microsite occupancy by juveniles. Among the non-pioneers, one species pair (Lecythis and Minquartia: Group A) was associated with low crown illumination and mature-phase forest in all juvenile stages. For two species (Dipteryx and Hymenolobium: Group B) the smallest saplings were in predominantly low-light, mature-forest sites, but crown illumination and association with gap- or building-phase sites increased with juvenile size (Simarouba also showed this pattern). Two species (Pithecellobium and Hyeronima: Group C) were strongly associated with gap or building phase as small juveniles (@<4 cm diameter) and again as subcanopy trees (>10-20 cm diameter), but were predominantly in mature-phase sites at intermediate sizes. Juveniles of the two pioneer species (Cecropia: Group D) showed the highest crown illumination and association with gap or building sites. Among the six non-pioneer species, only one aspect of juvenile performance clearly varied according to microsite group. The smallest saplings (@<1 cm diameter) of Groups B and C showed significant mortality differences across a small gradient in crown illumination; neither of the Group A species showed this pattern. Otherwise, juvenile performance was strikingly similar among the six species. All showed a capacity for growth responses to small increases in light, substantial height and diameter increments at higher light levels, equal ability to survive 4-yr periods of no growth, and very low mortality rates at intermediate-to-large juvenile sizes. Species differed significantly in growth rates, but relative differences shifted with tree size and were unrelated to microsite group. These findings do not support prevailing paradigms concerning trade-offs and correlated suites of traits. For non-pioneer tropical trees, life history classification based on generalized concepts such as gap dependence and shade tolerance is inadequate to describe the complex size-dependent patterns of life history differences and similarities that exist among species.},

abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

abstract = {A better understanding of the relationship between stand structure and productivity is required for the development of: a) scalable models that can accurately predict growth and yield dynamics for the world's forests; and b) stand management regimes that maximize wood and/or timber yield, while maintaining structural and species diversity. We develop a cohort-based canopy competition model ({\textquotedblleft}CAIN{\textquotedblright}), parameterized with inventory data from Ontario, Canada, to examine the relationship between stand structure and productivity. Tree growth, mortality and recruitment are quantified as functions of diameter and asymmetric competition, using a competition index (CAIh) defined as the total projected area of tree crowns at a given tree's mid-crown height. Stand growth, mortality, and yield are simulated for inventoried stands, and also for hypothetical stands differing in total volume and tree size distribution. For a given diameter, tree growth decreases as CAIh increases, whereas the probability of mortality increases. For a given CAIh, diameter growth exhibits a humped pattern with respect to diameter, whereas mortality exhibits a U-shaped pattern reflecting senescence of large trees. For a fixed size distribution, stand growth increases asymptotically with total density, whereas mortality increases monotonically. Thus, net productivity peaks at an intermediate volume of 100{\textendash}150 m3/ha, and approaches zero at 250 m3/ha. However, for a fixed stand volume, mortality due to senescence decreases if the proportion of large trees decreases as overall density increases. This size-related reduction in mortality offsets the density-related increase in mortality, resulting in a 40% increase in yield. Size-related variation in growth and mortality exerts a profound influence on the relationship between stand structure and productivity. Dense stands dominated by small trees yield more wood than stands dominated by fewer large trees, because the relative growth rate of small trees is higher, and because they are less likely to die.},

The shade treatments resulted in less total biomass for all species, with loblolly pine showing the greatest shade-induced growth reduction. Yellow-poplar was the only species to show increased stem height growth in the 89% shade treatment. The shade treatments increased specific leaf area of all species. Quantum efficiency, dark respiration and light compensation point were generally not affected by the shade treatments. Quantum efficiency, dark respiration, maximum photosynthesis and light compensation point did not change consistently between the first and second growing seasons. We conclude that differences in shade tolerance among these species are not the result of changes in the photosynthetic mechanism in response to shade.},

abstract = {Although linkages of leaf and whole-plant traits to leaf lifespan have been rigorously investigated, there is a limited understanding of similar linkages of whole-plant and fine root traits to root lifespan. In comparisons across species, do suites of traits found in leaves also exist for roots, and can these traits be used to predict root lifespan? We observed the fine root lifespan of 12 temperate tree species using minirhizotrons in a common garden and compared their median lifespans with fine-root and whole-plant traits. We then determined which set of combined traits would be most useful in predicting patterns of root lifespan. Median root lifespan ranged widely among species (95-336 d). Root diameter, calcium content, and tree wood density were positively related to root lifespan, whereas specific root length, nitrogen (N) : carbon (C) ratio, and plant growth rate were negatively related to root lifespan. Root diameter and plant growth rate, together (R{\texttwosuperior} = 0.62) or in combination with root N : C ratio (R{\texttwosuperior} = 0.76), were useful predictors of root lifespan across the 12 species. Our results highlight linkages between fine root lifespan in temperate trees and plant functional traits that may reduce uncertainty in predictions of root lifespan or turnover across species at broader spatial scales.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic gas exchange, nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, leaf water potential and seasonal patterns of leaf production were studied in seven, dominant dry-forest species from the island of Lana'i, Hawaii, including the rapidly colonizing, non-native Schinus terebinthifolius (Raddi). We evaluated whether unique physiological characteristics of the invasive species explain its capacity to rapidly invade dry forests throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Apparent anomalies in stable carbon isotope data ({delta}13C) relative to other results led us to study effects of environmental conditions and physiological performance during leaf expansion on {delta}13C. Species that expanded all their foliage at the beginning of the wet season had more negative leaf {delta}13C values during the dry season than species with continuous leaf expansion. Among species, S. terebinthifolius had a strong seasonal pattern of leaf production and the most negative {delta}13C (-29{per thousand}). With respect to almost every trait measured, S. terebinthifolius fell at an end of the range of values for the native species. Rapid growth of S. terebinthifolius in this ecosystem may be partially explained by its high maximum CO2 assimilation rates (15 {micro}mol m-2 s-1), low leaf mass per area, high photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency per unit leaf mass or area and large decrease in stomatal conductance during the dry season. Relative to the native species, the invasive species exhibited striking phenotypic plasticity, including high rates of stem growth and water and CO2 uptake during the wet season, and maintenance of leaves and high leaf water potentials, as a result of reduced water loss, during the dry season, enabling it to utilize available resources effectively.},

abstract = {1 We examined how seed size and seedling growth rate influence recruitment success of neotropical pioneer species. We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panam{\'a}.2 To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design.3 Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots.4 We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season.5 In the 18~months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.6 We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence{\textendash}establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.},

abstract = {We examined the response of hybrid poplar to elevated CO2 in contrasting growth environments: controlled environment chamber (CE). open-top chamber (OTC) and poplar free air CO2 enrichment (POPFACE) in order to compare short versus long-term effects and to determine whether generalisations in response are possible for this fast growing tree. Leaf growth, which for poplar is an important determinant of stemwood productivity was followed in all environments, as were the determinants of leaf growth-cell expansion and cell production. Elevated CO2 (550-700 micromol mol(-1), depending on environment) resulted in an increase in final leaf size for Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides (Populus x interamericana) and P. deltoides x Populus nigra (Populus x euramericana), irrespective of whether plants were exposed during a short-term CE glasshouse study (90 days), a long-term OTC experiment (3 years) or during the first year of a POPFACE experiment. An exception was observed in the closed canopy POPFACE experiment, where final leaf size remained unaltered by CO2. Increased leaf extension rate was observed in elevated CO2 in all experiments, at some point during leaf development, as determined by leaf length. Again the exception were the POPFACE experiment, where effects were not statistically significant. Leaf production and specific leaf area (SLA) were increased and decreased, respectively, on five out of six occasions, although both were only statistically significant on two occasions and interestingly for SLA never in the FACE experiment. Although both cell expansion and cell production were sensitive to CO2 concentration, effects appeared highly dependent on growth environment and genotype. However, increased leaf cell expansion in elevated CO2 was often associated with changes in the biophysical properties of the cell wall, usually increased cell wall plasticity. This research has shown that enhanced leaf area development was a consistent response to elevated CO2 but that the magnitude of this response is likely to decline, in long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Effects on SLA and leaf production suggest that CE and OTC experiments may not always provide good predictors of the 'qualitative' effects of elevated CO2 in long-term ecosystem experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Success of invasive plant species is thought to be linked with their higher leaf carbon fixation strategy, enabling them to capture and utilize resources better than native species, and thus pre-empt and maintain space. However, these traits are not well-defined for invasive woody vines. METHODS: In a glass house setting, experiments were conducted to examine how leaf carbon gain strategies differ between non-indigenous invasive and native woody vines of south-eastern Australia, by investigating their biomass gain, leaf structural, nutrient and physiological traits under changing light and moisture regimes. KEY RESULTS: Leaf construction cost (CC), calorific value and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) ratio were lower in the invasive group, while ash content, N, maximum photosynthesis, light-use efficiency, photosynthetic energy-use efficiency (PEUE) and specific leaf area (SLA) were higher in this group relative to the native group. Trait plasticity, relative growth rate (RGR), photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and water-use efficiency did not differ significantly between the groups. However, across light resource, regression analyses indicated that at a common (same) leaf CC and PEUE, a higher biomass RGR resulted for the invasive group; also at a common SLA, a lower CC but higher N resulted for the invasive group. Overall, trait co-ordination (using pair-wise correlation analyses) was better in the invasive group. Ordination using 16 leaf traits indicated that the major axis of invasive-native dichotomy is primarily driven by SLA and CC (including its components and/or derivative of PEUE) and was significantly linked with RGR. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that while not all measures of leaf resource traits may differ between the two groups, the higher level of trait correlation and higher revenue returned (RGR) per unit of major resource need (CC) and use (PEUE) in the invasive group is in line with their rapid spread where introduced.},

abstract = {Tolerance is the ability of a plant to regrow or reproduce following damage. While experimental studies typically measure tolerance in response to the intensity of herbivory (i.e., the amount of leaf tissue removed in one attack), the impact of how many times plants are attacked during a growing season (i.e., the frequency of damage) is virtually unexplored. Using experimental defoliations that mimicked patterns of attack by leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.), we examined how the frequency of herbivory influenced plant tolerance traits in six tree species in Brazil's Cerrado. For 2 years we quantified how monthly and quarterly damage influenced individual survivorship, relative growth rate, plant architecture, flowering, and foliar chemistry. We found that the content of leaf nitrogen (N) increased among clipped individuals of most species, suggesting that Atta influences the allocation of resources in damaged plants. Furthermore, our clipping treatments affected tree architecture in ways thought to promote tolerance. However, none of our focal species exhibited a compensatory increase in growth (increment in trunk diameter) in response to herbivory as relative growth rates were significantly lower in clipped than in unclipped individuals. In addition, the probability of survival was much lower for clipped plants, and lower for plants clipped monthly than those clipped quarterly. For plants that did survive, simulated herbivory dramatically reduced the probability of flowering. Our results were similar across a phylogenetically distinct suite of species, suggesting a potential extendability of these findings to other plant species in this system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The size and composition of seed reserves may reflect the ecological strategy and evolutionary history of a species and also temporal variation in resource availability. The seed mass and composition of seed reserves of 19 co-existing tree species were studied, and we examined how they varied among species in relation to germination and seedling growth rates, as well as between two years with contrasting precipitation (652 and 384 mm). METHODS: Seeds were collected from a tropical deciduous forest in the northwest of Mexico (Chamela Biological Station). The seed dry mass, with and without the seed coat, and the concentrations of lipids, nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates for the seed minus seed coat were determined. The anatomical localization of these reserves was examined using histochemical analysis. The germination capacity, rate and lag time were determined. The correlations among these variables, and their relationship to previously reported seedling relative growth rates, were evaluated with and without phylogenetic consideration. KEY RESULTS: There were interannual differences in seed mass and reserve composition. Seed was significantly heavier after the drier year in five species. Nitrogen concentration was positively correlated with seed coat fraction, and was significantly higher after the drier year in 12 species. The rate and lag time of germination were negatively correlated with each other. These trait correlations were also supported for phylogenetic independent contrasts. Principal component analysis supported these correlations, and indicated a negative association of seedling relative growth rate with seed size, and a positive association of germination rate with nitrogen and lipid concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Nitrogen concentration tended to be higher after the drier year and, while interannual variations in seed size and reserve composition were not sufficient to affect interspecific correlations among seed and seedling traits, some of the reserves were related to germination variables and seedling relative growth rate.},

abstract = {1. A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey). 2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2{\textperiodcentered}6 mM N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth. 3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun. 4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia, the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen. 5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea, the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade. 6. Functional morphology of cotyledons and concentration of seed nitrogen deserve as much attention as seed size as correlates of contrasting seedling regeneration strategies.},

At steady-state, ozone exposure induced an uncoupling of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, as the former decreased while the latter did not. Dynamic stomatal response was investigated by cutting the leaf petiole after a steady-state stomatal conductance was reached. Ozone exposure increased stomatal sluggishness, i.e., slowed stomatal response after leaf cutting, in the following order of sensitivity, F. chinensis>A. altissima>P. orientalis. A restriction of stomatal ozone flux reduced the ozone-induced sluggishness in P. orientalis. The ozone-induced impairment of stomatal control was better explained by stomatal ozone flux per net photosynthesis rather than by stomatal ozone flux only. This suggests that ozone injury to stomatal control depends both on the amount of ozone entering a leaf and on the capacity for biochemical detoxification or repair. Leaf mass per area and the density of stomata did not affect stomatal sluggishness.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Although shade tolerance is often assumed to be a fixed trait of species, recent work has reported size-related changes in the relative and absolute light requirements of woody taxa. We hypothesized that, in evergreen forests, light requirements of shade-tolerant species that accumulate multiple foliage cohorts will be more stable during juvenile ontogeny than those of intolerant species with short leaf lifetimes. 2. We quantified the light environments occupied by three size classes of 13 coexisting evergreens in a temperate rainforest, to determine how size influenced their relative shade tolerance. Minimum light requirements ({MLRs)} of species were estimated by computing the 10th percentile of the distribution of juveniles in relation to percentage canopy openness, for each size class. Leaf life span in low light (2%-5% canopy openness) was estimated by recording survival of marked leaves over 12 months, or retrospectively on species with clearly discernible foliage cohorts. 3. Agreement of ranks of species{\textquoteright} {MLR} across size classes was significant, although not strong (Kendall's W = 0.159, P = 0.02). {MLRs} of the most shade-tolerant species changed little between size-classes, whereas those of most of the less-tolerant species rose with increasing size. 4. Shift in {MLR} across size-classes was negatively correlated with leaf life span, possibly because of the effects of leaf life span on biomass distribution and whole-plant carbon balance. Survival of light-demanding species with short leaf lifetimes may thus depend on their encountering increasing light levels as they grow taller, whereas progressive accumulation of an extensive leaf area by late-successional taxa enables them to continue to tolerate low light despite increasing size. 5. Results suggest that shade-tolerance differences between evergreens become increasingly apparent with increasing size. In identifying a relationship with leaf life span, this work also provides a basis for predicting changes in species{\textquoteright} light requirements during juvenile ontogeny.},

Dose{\textendash}response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves ({LMF)} increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the {LMF-response} to light, but makes the effect of temperature on {LMF} more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in {LMF} is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio ({SLA).} In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

abstract = {1. Aristida stricta and Schizachyrium scoparium are C4 perennial bunchgrass species native to Pinus plaustris savannas in the south-eastern USA. Species differences in growth rate, tissue nutrient content and distribution suggest that A. stricta is more stress-tolerant (sensu Grime) than S. scoparium. In addition, A. stricta retains leaves all year, whereas S. scoparium is winter deciduous. Based on these observations, we wanted to determine (1) whether root longevity was higher for A. stricta as compared to S. scoparium; and (2) whether the leaf habits of these species had consequences for seasonal patterns of root production and death. 2. Using in situ rhizotrons, we recorded root number and length of these species over the course of 2{\textperiodcentered}5 years on flat, transparent 50 {\texttimes} 50 cm windows. Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) analysis was used to produce survival functions and to estimate median lifespans for the right-censored root longevity data. These survival functions were compared using log-rank $\chi$ 2 statistics, and a proportional hazards model was used to examine the effects of season and species on the survival of each cohort. Final demographic variables were analysed using ANOVA. 3. The median lifespan of A. stricta was 777 days whereas that of S. scoparium was 374 days. This significant difference in median lifespan was consistent between species for all cohorts in both years. Also, coincident with winter leaf senescence, root production nearly stopped for S. scoparium whereas A. stricta produced roots all year. This is probably due to the winter photosynthetic capacity of A. stricta. Root death did not exhibit any seasonal pattern in either species. A pulse of roots produced in apparent response to the 2000 drought was evident for S. scoparium but not for A. stricta. This cohort, however, rapidly died during the dormant season, probably due to the lack of winter photosynthesis in that species. 4. Aristida stricta and S. scoparium exhibited root production, death and longevity patterns that were predicted on the basis of ecological and leaf habit differences between them. These findings suggest species-specific differences in performance and element cycling in these nutrient-poor soils.},

We evaluated whether species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy.

I compared photosynthetic physiology, growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of three shade-tolerant tree species, Virola koschynii Warb., Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record {\&} Mell and Brosimum alicastrum Swartz., growing across a light gradient created by a forest-pasture edge (0.5 to 67% diffuse transmittance (%T)). Most growth and physiological traits showed nonlinear responses to light availability, with the greatest changes occurring between 0.5 and 20 %T. Specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen per unit leaf mass (N mass) decreased, maximum assimilation per unit leaf area (A area) and area-based leaf N concentration (N area) increased, and maximum assimilation per unit leaf mass (A mass) did not change with increasing irradiance. Plastic responses in SLA were important determinants of leaf N and A area across the gradient. Species differed in magnitude and plasticity of growth; B. alicastrum had the lowest relative growth rates (RGR) and low plasticity. Its final biomass varied only 10-fold across the light gradient. In contrast, the final biomass of D. panamensis and V. koschynii varied by 100- and 50-fold, respectively, and both had higher RGR than B. alicastrum. As light availability increased, all species decreased biomass allocation to leaf tissue (mass and area) and showed a trade-off between allocation to leaf area at a given plant mass (LAR) and net gain in mass per unit leaf area (net assimilation rate, NAR). This trade-off largely reflected declines in SLA with increasing light. Finally, A area was correlated with NAR and both were major determinants of intraspecific variation in RGR. These data indicate the importance of plasticity in photosynthetic physiology and allocation for variation in tree seedling growth among habitats that vary in light availability.},

Introduction to Meta-Analysis: Outlines the role of meta-analysis in the research process Shows how to compute effects sizes and treatment effects Explains the fixed-effect and random-effects models for synthesizing data Demonstrates how to assess and interpret variation in effect size across studies Clarifies concepts using text and figures, followed by formulas and examples Explains how to avoid common mistakes in meta-analysis Discusses controversies in meta-analysis Features a web site with additional material and exercises A superb combination of lucid prose and informative graphics, written by four of the world{\textquoteright}s leading experts on all aspects of meta-analysis. Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein provide a refreshing departure from cookbook approaches with their clear explanations of the what and why of meta-analysis. The book is ideal as a course textbook or for self-study. My students, who used pre-publication versions of some of the chapters, raved about the clarity of the explanations and examples. David Rindskopf, Distinguished Professor of Educational Psychology, City University of New York, Graduate School and University Center, {\&} Editor of the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics. The approach taken by Introduction to Meta-analysis is intended to be primarily conceptual, and it is amazingly successful at achieving that goal. The reader can comfortably skip the formulas and still understand their application and underlying motivation. For the more statistically sophisticated reader, the relevant formulas and worked examples provide a superb practical guide to performing a meta-analysis. The book provides an eclectic mix of examples from education, social science, biomedical studies, and even ecology. For anyone considering leading a course in meta-analysis, or pursuing self-directed study, Introduction to Meta-analysis would be a clear first choice. Jesse A. Berlin, ScD Introduction to Meta-Analysis is an excellent resource for novices and experts alike. The book provides a clear and comprehensive presentation of all basic and most advanced approaches to meta-analysis. This book will be referenced for decades. Michael A.

abstract = {Seedlings of several species of gymnosperm trees, angiosperm trees, and angiosperm lianas were grown under tropical field conditions in the Republic of Panama; physiological processes controlling plant C and water fluxes were assessed across this functionally diverse range of species. Relative growth rate, r, was primarily controlled by the ratio of leaf area to plant mass, of which specific leaf area was a key component. Instantaneous photosynthesis, when expressed on a leaf-mass basis, explained 69% of variation in r (P < 0.0001, n = 94). Mean r of angiosperms was significantly higher than that of the gymnosperms; within angiosperms, mean r of lianas was higher than that of trees. Whole-plant nitrogen use efficiency was also significantly higher in angiosperm than in gymnosperm species, and was primarily controlled by the rate of photosynthesis for a given amount of leaf nitrogen. Whole-plant water use efficiency, TE(c), varied significantly among species, and was primarily controlled by c(i)/c(a), the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO(2) partial pressures during photosynthesis. Instantaneous measurements of c(i)/c(a) explained 51% of variation in TE(c) (P < 0.0001, n = 94). Whole-plant (13)C discrimination also varied significantly as a function of c(i)/c(a) (R(2) = 0.57, P < 0.0001, n = 94), and was, accordingly, a good predictor of TE(c). The (18)O enrichment of stem dry matter was primarily controlled by the predicted (18)O enrichment of evaporative sites within leaves (R(2) = 0.61, P < 0.0001, n = 94), with some residual variation explained by mean transpiration rate. Measurements of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios could provide a useful means of parameterizing physiological models of tropical forest trees.},

The {\textquoteleft}whole-plant compensation point{\textquoteright}, interpolated from stem growth measurements across a wide range of light environments, has been proposed as a simple, robust measure of species shade tolerance. Others have argued that shade tolerance is primarily a function of differential ability to survive periods of slow growth ({\textquoteleft}suppression{\textquoteright}), implying that measurements of survival are vital. * We measured growth of juveniles (500{\textendash}1000 mm tall) of five evergreen trees over 12 months in a cool-temperate rain forest in New Zealand, to determine whether whole-plant compensation points predicted species differences in occupancy of understorey light environments, which were quantified using hemispherical photography. * The five species encompassed 3{\textperiodcentered}5-fold variation in whole-plant compensation points. Compensation points of most species fell within the first quartile of the distribution of light environments occupied by juveniles; they were also correlated with low-light mortality rates of juveniles, estimated from permanent plot data archived in the National Vegetation Survey Databank. Compensation points were also significantly positively correlated with height growth rates in high light, confirming the presence of the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off detected in many other forest tree assemblages. * Results show that, in temperate evergreen forests, the whole-plant compensation point distinguishes reliably between species of differing shade tolerance. Excepting situations involving parameterization of demographic models, shade tolerance can therefore be assessed without survival measurements. However, estimating whole-plant compensation points may prove more difficult in deciduous forests, where seasonal variation in understorey light transmission poses additional challenges.},

abstract = {Although the impact of nitrogen availability on the night-time water relations of plants has received a lot of attention during the last decade, knowledge of how these two traits are interrelated is contradictory and still limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of leaf nitrogen concentration on night-time (Enap) and daytime (Ed) transpiration rate, nightly water-use percentage of daytime water use (NWU), and increase in night-time transpiration rate (INT) in artificial predawn hours in the cut shoots of 16 woody species measured in the controlled conditions of a growth chamber. Two distinct patterns of night-time water use associated with leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) were observed: shoots with high NWU were characterised by significantly (P<0.05) lower [N], whereas shoots with highest INT had greater [N]. The forward stepwise regression analysis revealed that variability in Ed, NWU and INT depended on [N], whereas the impact of other predictor variables (leaf phosphorus concentration, habitat soil water content and light availability) was insignificant (P>0.05). Our results suggest that high NWU could potentially compensate limited nitrogen uptake in species able to grow in nutrient-poor habitats. Furthermore, night-time stomatal regulation mechanisms may differ between species according to their [N] and this may explain the contradictory results between previous studies.},

abstract = {Warming, watering and elevated atmospheric CO₂-concentration effects have been extensively studied separately; however, their combined impact on plants is not well understood. In the current research, we examined plant growth and physiological responses of three dominant species from the Eurasian Steppe with different functional traits to a combination of elevated CO₂, high temperature, and four simulated precipitation patterns. Elevated CO₂ stimulated plant growth by 10.8-41.7 % for a C₃ leguminous shrub, Caragana microphylla, and by 33.2-52.3 % for a C₃ grass, Stipa grandis, across all temperature and watering treatments. Elevated CO₂, however, did not affect plant biomass of a C₄ grass, Cleistogenes squarrosa, under normal or increased precipitation, whereas a 20.0-69.7 % stimulation of growth occurred with elevated CO₂ under drought conditions. Plant growth was enhanced in the C₃ shrub and the C₄ grass by warming under normal precipitation, but declined drastically with severe drought. The effects of elevated CO₂ on leaf traits, biomass allocation and photosynthetic potential were remarkably species-dependent. Suppression of photosynthetic activity, and enhancement of cell peroxidation by a combination of warming and severe drought, were partly alleviated by elevated CO₂. The relationships between plant functional traits and physiological activities and their responses to climate change were discussed. The present results suggested that the response to CO₂ enrichment may strongly depend on the response of specific species under varying patterns of precipitation, with or without warming, highlighting that individual species and multifactor dependencies must be considered in a projection of terrestrial ecosystem response to climatic change.},

abstract = {To understand the relationship between the dynamics of tropical rain forests and the population processes of individual species, data are needed on the rates at which trees grow, die, and establish. Data on the family Moraceae have been extracted from long-term forestry studies in Sarawak, on the northwest coast of Borneo, an area at the center of species richness of Old World tropical forests. These data can also be combined with forest maps and logging studies to investigate the importance of competition and disturbance in controlling tree growth. Tree populations of Moraceae species had mean annual diameter increments of between 0.4 and 3 mm/yr. Growth rates increased two to six times in the 1st and 2nd yr following (selective) logging, but began to decline somewhat in the 3rd and 4th yr. Growth rate variation among trees in a population was considerable, with most trees showing little or no growth, and a few, high growth rates. Saplings of Artocarpus species increased in diameter at the same mean rate as adult trees. Annual mortality rates were low in primary forest, typically <3%, and indicated stable populations. In logged forest, annual mortality of Artocarpus species was considerably higher, between 5 and 8% for trees and still higher for saplings. Adults and saplings of Ficus, a pioneer species, had much higher annual mortality rates than individuals of Artocarpus. Growth rates of Moraceae trees in primary forest were positively correlated with the growth of the nearest conspecific trees, the mean growth rates of the three nearest neighbors of any species, and the mean distance to the nearest neighbors, but were not correlated with the diameter of the tree itself and the mean diameter of the three nearest neighbors. Analysis of patches of three trees of any species in primary forest revealed that there were no detectable differences among patches in either tree size or growth rate. Tree growth rates of small patches in logged forest were negatively correlated with distance to the nearest forest opening. Even the significant relationships between tree growth rate and immediate neighborhood explained only a relatively small portion of the total variation in growth rate. The remaining variation may be due to variation in plant genotype and local environment.},

abstract = {Interspecific differences in tree performance due to variation in resource availability are expected to influence the structure and dynamics of tropical forest communities. Patterns of mortality and growth over 32 mo in 11 species of Macaranga were analyzed to investigate factors influencing tree spatial distributions and the dynamics of early successional communities. Tree performance was assessed in relation to variation in light levels, soil texture, and tree ontogeny. Rates of mortality and growth varied by over an order of magnitude among species. Species common in high-light microsites had higher mortality and growth rates. Higher low-light mortality for these species reflected lower shade tolerances, supporting the view that shade tolerance involves a trade-off between high-light growth and low-light mortality. Logistic and multiple regressions were used to test for independent effects of tree size and microenvironment on performance in the 11 species. Mortality and growth were significantly related to tree size in nine and eight species, respectively. Higher mortality and lower growth rates for juvenile trees were common. Despite positive correlations between light availability and tree size, mortality rates increased in three species, and growth rates decreased in four species at larger tree sizes. This pattern was particularly strong in smaller statured shade-intolerant species and may reflect changes in biomass allocation following reproductive onset. Declines in growth at larger tree sizes for only some species resulted in changes in species' performance rankings through succession. Low-light mortality rates were strongly correlated with species' distributions in the forest with respect to light levels, whereas biases in distributions with respect to soil texture were not supported by differential mortality. For all trees pooled and in several species, growth showed a threshold response to light levels, being light-limited in low light but not in high light. Across all light levels, soil texture significantly influenced growth in six species. Five species and all trees pooled had significantly lower growth on the more nutrient-poor and potentially drought-prone sandy soils. The dynamics of Macaranga-dominated early successional communities are strongly influenced by soil resource and light availability, coupled with species-specific ontogenetic trajectories of performance.},

abstract = {One of the factors thought to contribute to ontogenetic declines in plant growth rates is diminishing light interception efficiency, as a result of the difficulties of avoiding self-shading among a growing number of leaves, and by stems. The effects of plant size on self-shading and light interception have rarely been quantified, however. We used a three-dimensional digitising system to construct virtual models of the architecture of Araucaria araucana seedlings 71 to 358 mm tall, and modelled their light interception in the forest understorey using the program YPLANT. We also analyzed seedling allometry, to determine the combined effects of biomass distribution and self-shading on total light interception. Average light interception efficiencies calculated for A. araucana (29 %) were the lowest reported for rainforest tree seedlings, reflecting the limitations imposed by short leaves, lack of petioles and an inability to develop planar foliage geometry on branches. Total light interception was related to seedling leaf area by an exponent of 0.735, reflecting increasing self-shading as seedlings grew bigger. However, because leaf area was related to seedling mass by an exponent of 1.24, light interception scaled nearly isometrically (0.91 power) with seedling mass. This resulted from taller plants having proportionally thinner stems, and a smaller fraction of their biomass in roots. Thus, an ontogenetic increase in self-shading in A. araucana is largely offset by allocation changes which increase leaf area ratio as seedlings grow bigger. These mechanisms conserving the relationship of light interception with plant mass seem likely to be restricted to species with long-lived leaves, growing in humid situations protected from wind stress. In open habitats, where wind and drought stress likely make such allocation patterns less feasible, the role of self-shading in ontogenetic declines in relative growth rate may be more evident.},

Nyman and the evergreen tree Pinus sylvestris L. were compared in a subarctic environment using material grown in pots. The species showed similar growth rates under low nutrient conditions, while Betula grew faster under high nutrient conditions. The higher growth rate of Betula under high nutrient conditions is apparently a function of a larger leaf area per unit plant mass combined with a larger proportion by weight of roots. Intraspecific variation in the growth rates of both species was mainly caused by differences in unit leaf rates. The unit leaf rate was higher for Pinus than for Betula under nutrient poor conditions but there was little difference when species were growing under nutrient rich conditions. The leaf productivity per unit leaf nitrogen was similar for both species when grown under nutrient poor conditions but Betula was more productive per unit N under high nutrient conditions. The species showed similar relations between nitrogen uptake and root mass. Betula lost 5-25% of the whole plant nitrogen at leaf abscission, while Pinus lost 0-2.6% of the nitrogen in the leaves which were shed during a year. The plasticity in dry matter partitioning was relatively small for both species when compared with woody plants in more southern environments.},

abstract = {1. Under nutrient-poor conditions initially fast-growing species will in the long term be competitively inferior to slow-growing species. Here, we ask whether this phenomenon can be explained by constraints caused by tissue density. The hypothesis is that low tissue density is necessary for fast growth but has as a consequence short organ life span. This leads to a rapid loss of nutrients that cannot be sustained under nutrient-poor conditions. 2. Biomass accumulation, turnover rate of leaves and roots, and tissue density were studied for five ecologically contrasting grass species. Plants were grown in a garden experiment over two growing seasons on sand with a low nutrient supply level. 3. Species that were characteristic of nutrient-rich sites had a low leaf and root tissue density and were larger after one growing season than species of nutrient-poor sites. However, after two growing seasons the species of nutrient-poor sites were larger. These species had a high tissue density. 4. Life span of both leaves and roots was also correlated with tissue density. Species with low tissue density had a faster turnover of leaves and roots. 5. It is concluded that tissue structure is an inherent constraint that prevents simultaneous maximization of both nutrient acquisition and nutrient conservation. The short life span of fast-growing organs explains the long-term disadvantage of a high growth rate for plants in low nutrient conditions.},

To quantify the vegetation pattern and examine its environmental basis, vegetation and soil samples were taken throughout the elevational range of the mosaic. Analysis of the samples indicated that the patches of evergreen vegetation occur on extremely acid, infertile soils (derived from hydrothermally altered rock), while deciduous vegetation dominates on less acid, more fertile soil (derived from unaltered volcanic rock). The two community types have very little floristic overlap, and the deciduous forest has much higher density of woody plants and greater species richness. The actual location of boundaries between patches of the two community types can be more abrupt than can be accounted for by soil change. At higher elevations (above 1100 m) evergreen woodland is not restricted to acid soils and occurs on all soil types. These data are discussed in terms of a general model to account for the association of evergreen plants with nutrient-poor soils in the Sierra Madre as well as in other areas with similar growth form soil fertility patterns. I propose that evergreen plants would grow and survive at least as well on fertile soils as on infertile soils in isolation, but are unable to establish in dense, productive vegetation because of low growth rates associated with high carbon costs and low photosynthetic rates of evergreen leaves.},

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that tropical trees partition forest light environments through a life history trade-off between juvenile growth and survival; however, the generality of this trade-off across life stages and functional groups has been questioned. We quantified trade-offs between growth and survival for trees and lianas on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama using first-year seedlings of 22 liana and 31 tree species and saplings (10 mm < dbh < 39 mm) of 30 tree species. Lianas showed trade-offs similar to those of trees, with both groups exhibiting broadly overlapping ranges in survival and relative growth rates as seedlings. Life history strategies at the seedling stage were highly correlated with those at the sapling stage among tree species, with all species showing an increase in survival with size. Only one of 30 tree species demonstrated a statistically significant ontogenetic shift, having a relatively lower survival rate at the sapling stage than expected. Our results indicate that similar life history trade-offs apply across two functional groups (lianas and trees), and that life history strategies are largely conserved across seedling and sapling life-stages for most tropical tree species.},

abstract = {Background and AimsThe volume of tree stems is made up of three components: solid wood, gas and water. These components have important consequences for the construction costs, strength and stability of trees. Here, the importance of stem components for sapling growth and survival in the field was investigated, and then these stem components were related to two important life history axes of variation: the light requirements for regeneration and the adult stature of the species. MethodsStem fractions of wood, gas and water were determined for saplings and adults of respectively 30 and 58 Bolivian tropical moist-forest species. Sapling height growth and survival were monitored for 2 years in the field as indicators of sapling performance. Key ResultsSapling stems consisted of 26 % wood (range 7-36 % for species), 59 % water (range 49-88 %), and 15 % gas (range 0-38 %) per unit volume. The wood fraction was the only determinant of sapling performance and was correlated with increased survival and decreased growth rate across species. The wood fraction decreased with light requirements of the species, probably because a high wood fraction protects shade-tolerant species against pathogens and falling debris. The gas fraction increased with the light requirements and adult stature of the species; probably as an aid in realizing a rapid height growth and accessing the canopy in the case of light-demanding species, and for rapidly attaining stability and a large reproductive size in the case of tall species. The water fraction was not correlated with the life history variation of tree species, probably because it leads to increased stem loading and decreased stability. ConclusionsThe wood fraction might partially explain the growth-survival trade-off that has been found across tropical tree species. The wood and gas fractions are closely related to the regeneration light requirements of the species. Tall species have a high gas fraction, probably not only because gas is a cheap filler, but also because it might lead to an increased stability of these tall trees.},

abstract = {In a comparative study of 42 rainforest tree species we examined relationships amongst wood traits, diameter growth and survival of large trees in the field, and shade tolerance and adult stature of the species. The species show two orthogonal axes of trait variation: a primary axis related to the vessel size number trade-off (reflecting investment in hydraulic conductance vs hydraulic safety) and a secondary axis related to investment in parenchyma vs fibres (storage vs strength). Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (Kp), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density. Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large Kp. Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk. Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field. Vessel traits and wood density are therefore important components of the performance and life history strategies of tropical tree species.},

abstract = {As trees grow larger and older they show characteristic changes in their proportions and growth rates. This paper explores the hypothesis that mechanical support costs of growing trees contributes to tree height limitation and general growth decline in aging trees. The chapter reviews scaling hypotheses, including geometric similarity, elastic similarity, stress similarity, and the pipe model, as well as the patterns in tree allometry that have been reported. It then uses the remarkable published record of diameter, volume and height growth, deriving from stem analysis, of one 437-year-old, 83-m-tall noble fir ( Abies procera ) to evaluate the degree to which different scaling models apply at different stages in that tree{\textquoteright}s life. The analysis suggests that the overall pattern of height growth could be related to tree allometry and wood production rates, but that the tree showed substantial decadal variation around the general patterns. The chapter suggests that many more studies are needed to characterize individual trees, either with known environments or after manipulations that alter allometry, and in different ecosystems beyond the Pacific Northwest and California. Such data will enable scientists to analyze the degree to which these allometric models pertain in different plant types and at different life stages, and will give insight into the role of mechanical and hydraulic support in the limitation of tree growth and productivity.},

abstract = {Differential herbivory and/or differential plant resistance or tolerance in sun and shade environments may influence plant distribution along the light gradient. Embothrium coccineum is one of the few light-demanding tree species in the temperate rainforest of southern South America, and seedlings are frequently attacked by insects and snails. Herbivory may contribute to the exclusion of E. coccineum from the shade if 1) herbivory pressure is greater in the shade, which in turn can result from shade plants being less resistant or from habitat preferences of herbivores, and/or 2) consequences of damage are more detrimental in the shade, i.e., shade plants are less tolerant. We tested this in a field study with naturally established seedlings in treefall gaps (sun) and forest understory (shade) in a temperate rainforest of southern Chile. Seedlings growing in the sun sustained nearly 40% more herbivore damage and displayed half of the specific leaf area than those growing in the shade. A palatability test showed that a generalist snail consumed ten times more leaf area when fed on shade leaves compared to sun leaves, i.e., plant resistance was greater in sun-grown seedlings. Herbivore abundance (total biomass) was two-fold greater in treefall gaps compared to the forest understory. Undamaged seedlings survived better and showed a slightly higher growth rate in the sun. Whereas simulated herbivory in the shade decreased seedling survival and growth by 34% and 19%, respectively, damaged and undamaged seedlings showed similar survival and growth in the sun. Leaf tissue lost to herbivores in the shade appears to be too expensive to replace under the limiting light conditions of forest understory. Following evaluations of herbivore abundance and plant resistance and tolerance in contrasting light environments, we have shown how herbivory on a light-demanding tree species may contribute to its exclusion from shade sites. Thus, in the shaded forest understory, where the seedlings of some tree species are close to their physiological tolerance limit, herbivory could play an important role in plant establishment.},

abstract = {How long forest trees can sustain wood production with increasing age remains an open question, primarily because whole-crown structure and growth cannot be readily measured from the ground or on felled trees. We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species {\textendash} Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens {\textendash} representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351 m3) than contained in any tree we measured <1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

Fire has been burning ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping to shape global biome distribution and to maintain the structure and function of fire-prone communities. Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world. Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation. We point to the common questions, and some surprisingly different answers, that emerge from viewing fire as a globally significant consumer that is analogous to herbivory.},

abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon cycle, providing substantial feedback to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle--particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage--increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands. Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree, in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level and stand-level productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree's total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to undertand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation and plant senescence.},

Its ability to grow in diverse soil conditions and minimal requirements of essential agronomical inputs compared to other oilseed crops makes it viable for cost-effective advanced biofuel production. We designed a study to investigate the effects of elevated [CO2 ] (550 ppm) on the growth, reproductive development, source-sink relationships, fruit and seed yield of Jatropha curcas. We report, for the first time that elevated CO2 significantly influences reproductive characteristics of Jatropha and improve its fruit and seed yields. Net photosynthetic rate of Jatropha was 50% higher in plants grown in elevated CO2 compared with field and ambient CO2 -grown plants. The study also revealed that elevated CO2 atmosphere significantly increased female to male flower ratio, above ground biomass and carbon sequestration potential in Jatropha (24 kg carbon tree(-1) ) after one year. Our data demonstrate that Jatropha curcas was able to sustain enhanced rates of photosynthesis in elevated CO2 conditions as it had sufficient sink strength to balance the increased biomass yields. Our study also elucidates that the economically important traits including fruit and seed yield in elevated CO2 conditions were significantly high in Jatropha curcas that holds great promise as a potential biofuel tree species for the future high CO2 world.},

abstract = {1. In this paper, a theoretical framework for the analysis of growth is described. Growth is equated with change in volume (V) and the growth rate is given by the equation; dV/dt = (dm/dt)(1/$\rho$)-(d$\rho$/dt)(m/$\rho$<sup>2</sup>) where m is the mass and $\rho$ the density. The volume is inclusive of internal air spaces. 2. The second term of the growth equation (see above) can be ignored if density is constant over time. Data for humans (and presumably other large animals) show that while composition changes over time, the density is approximately constant at about that of water. In that case, the growth rate can be estimated from measures of the rate of change of mass. However, the density of plants is variable (c. 0.4-1.2 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) and measures of mass and density are necessary to analyse plant growth. 3. To use the theory as the basis of plant growth models, it is necessary to develop simple methods for estimating the surface area of roots, stems and leaves assuming that the mass and volume are known. A literature review found that the surface area to volume ratios of leaves and roots generally increase with the mass concentration of water. Theoretical arguments are used to predict that in woody stems, the situation should be reversed such that the surface area to volume ratio increases with the mass concentration of dry matter. Those relationships should be very useful in the development of plant growth models. 4. Measures of plant dry mass and estimates of the rate of change in dry mass are shown to be very difficult to interpret because of differences in the mass concentration of dry matter between individuals and over time. 5. It is concluded that measures of mass and density will be necessary before plant growth analysis can achieve its full potential. A framework for extending the theory to include the forces necessary for growth to occur is described.},

abstract = {Classifying the biological traits of organisms can test conceptual frameworks of life-history strategies and allow for predictions of how different species may respond to environmental disturbances. We apply a trait-based classification approach to a complex and threatened group of species, scleractinian corals. Using hierarchical clustering and random forests analyses, we identify up to four life-history strategies that appear globally consistent across 143 species of reef corals: competitive, weedy, stress-tolerant and generalist taxa, which are primarily separated by colony morphology, growth rate and reproductive mode. Documented shifts towards stress-tolerant, generalist and weedy species in coral reef communities are consistent with the expected responses of these life-history strategies. Our quantitative trait-based approach to classifying life-history strategies is objective, applicable to any taxa and a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate theories of community ecology and predict the impact of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on species assemblages.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that species characteristic of nutrient rich sites always grow faster than species from nutrient poor sites, but have a shorter organ life span. It has been suggested that this fast tissue turnover may limit their performance at nutrient poor sites. Three ecologically contrasting grasses were studied: Bromus erectus, characteristic of nutrient poor meadows, and Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glomerata, characteristic of more nutrient rich grasslands. These species were grown at three meadows differing in nutrient availability and harvested 3, 7, 9.5 and 11 months after germination. D. glomerata produced at all sites the largest total biomass. B. erectus showed the lowest growth response to site conditions. D. glomerata and A. elatius had a faster leaf turnover than B. erectus. D. glomerata had a faster root turnover than B. erectus. Root turnover of A. elatius was probably also faster than that of B. erectus, but this was partially obscured by decomposition of dead roots. D. glomerata and A. elatius had a lower tissue density of leaves and roots than B. erectus. We conclude that there is a negative correlation between the plant's ability to increase its growth with increasing nutrient availability and the tissue life span. Nutrient losses due to fast tissue turnover may prevent the dominance of fast-growing species at nutrient poor sites, although these species are in general better at nutrient acquisition. The negative correlation between growth rate and tissue longevity is to a large extent a result of constraints caused by plant tissue structure.},

abstract = {In this study, we compare the relative growth rate (RGR) and biomass allocation of 10 woody species (5 deciduous and 5 evergreen) from the Mediterranean region using phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) to test if these two functional groups differ in these traits. In general, the results were similar when using PICs or without taking into account phylogenetic relations. Deciduous species had a higher RGR than evergreen species, due to the higher net assimilation rate (NAR). Deciduous species had a higher specific leaf area (SLA) but a lower leaf mass ratio (LMR), resulting in a similar LAR for deciduous and evergreen species (LAR = SLA x LMR). In some cases, the use of PICs revealed patterns that would not have appeared if phylogeny had been overlooked. For example, there was no significant correlation between RGR and final dry mass (after 4 months of growth) but PICs revealed that there was a positive relation between these two variables in all deciduous-evergreen pairs. In general, RGR decreased with time and this temporal variation was due primarily to NAR variations (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), and also to variations in LAR (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Considering the phylogeny, the only variable constantly different for all deciduous-evergreen pairs was SLA. This result, and the fact that SLA was the best correlated variable with RGR (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), reinforce the value of SLA as a variable closely associated to growth and to the functional groups (deciduous vs. evergreen).},

Using free air CO2 release in combination with a canopy crane, we found an immediate and sustained enhancement of carbon flux through 35-meter-tall temperate forest trees when exposed to elevated CO2. However, there was no overall stimulation in stem growth and leaf litter production after 4 years. Photosynthetic capacity was not reduced, leaf chemistry changes were minor, and tree species differed in their responses. Although growing vigorously, these trees did not accrete more biomass carbon in stems in response to elevated CO2, thus challenging projections of growth responses derived from tests with smaller trees.},

We contend that L/S should increase with H based on a numerical simulation, a mathematical analysis and a conceptual argument: (1) numerical simulation--a tree growth model, DESPOT (Deducing Emergent Structure and Physiology Of Trees), in which carbon (C) allocation is regulated to maximize C gain, predicts L/S should increase during most of H growth; (2) mathematical analysis--the formal criterion for optimal C allocation, applied to a simplified analytical model of whole tree carbon-water balance, predicts L/S should increase with H if leaf-level gas exchange parameters including gs are conserved; and (3) conceptual argument--photosynthesis is limited by several substitutable resources (chiefly nitrogen (N), water and light) and H growth increases the C cost of water transport but not necessarily of N and light capture, so if the goal is to maximize C gain or growth, allocation should shift in favor of increasing photosynthetic capacity and irradiance, rather than sustaining gs. Although many data are consistent with the prediction that L/S should decline with H, many others are not, and we discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies},

abstract = {To study the relationship between drought and oxidative stress and mechanisms of photo- and antioxidative protection in strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), the endogenous concentrations of xanthophyll cycle pigments, $\alpha$-tocopherol and reduced and oxidized ascorbate were measured in 2-year-old plants exposed to a combination of water deficit, high light and high temperatures in Mediterranean field conditions. Under moderate stress (relative leaf water content [RWC] of ca. 68%), levels of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and ascorbate were kept constant, while $\alpha$-tocopherol levels increased by ca. 50%. Under severe stress (RWC of ca. 53%): (i) $\alpha$-tocopherol levels remained high, (ii) zeaxanthin concentrations increased by 75%, (iii) ascorbate increased by 54% and its redox state shifted towards its oxidized form, and (iv) chlorophylls, lutein and $\beta$-carotene decreased by ca. 63, 61 and 75%, respectively. These results are consistent with the contentions that drought causes oxidative stress in A. unedo plants, and that mechanisms of photo- and antioxidative protection contribute to withstand drought-induced oxidative stress in this Mediterranean plant species.},

abstract = {An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2%) and high light (20%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.},

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.},

abstract = {Understanding how plant life history affects species vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances and environmental change is a major ecological challenge. We examined how vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size relate to extinction risk throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. We used a database containing species-level information of 6,929 angiosperms within 112 families and a molecular-based working phylogeny. We used decision trees, standard regression, and phylogenetic regression to explore the relationships between species attributes and extinction risk. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in extinction risk. Vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size were related to species extinction risk, but the effect of growth form was not evident after phylogeny was controlled for. Species restricted to either rocky outcrops or scrub vegetation on sandy coastal plains exhibited the highest extinction risk among vegetation types, a finding that supports the hypothesis that species adapted to resource-limited environments are more vulnerable to extinction. Among growth forms, epiphytes were associated with the highest extinction risk in non-phylogenetic regression models, followed by trees, whereas shrubs and climbers were associated with lower extinction risk. However, the higher extinction risk of epiphytes was not significant after correcting for phylogenetic relatedness. Our findings provide new indicators of extinction risk and insights into the mechanisms governing plant vulnerability to extinction in a highly diverse flora where human disturbances are both frequent and widespread.

Community averages of disturbance-sensitive attributes of trees, such as seed mass or wood density, were not correlated with variation in either rainfall or soil, but were strongly correlated with tree diversity. As such, the forests in central Guyana were characterized by generally a high average wood density, large seeds, and rodent or unassisted dispersal.

abstract = {We examined among- and within-species effects of seed mass for seedling establishment from seed to 5�years of age in a field experiment at Paracou, French Guiana. Six seeds of each of eight species were weighed and planted into each of 120 plots (1�m2) throughout closed-canopy forest along 12�100-m transects in 1998. We described the microhabitat of each planting site using principal components derived from measurements of light availability, soil moisture, carbon and nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus availability. Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species. Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1�year as well as from 1 to 5�years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly. We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment. Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.

(intermediate shade tolerant), and Prunus serotina Ehrh. (shade intolerant) were harvested from a forest understory to test the hypothesis that the pattern of biomass allocation varied predictably with shade-tolerance rank. The placement and length of branches along the main axis were consistent with the formation of a monolayer of foliage for the tolerant and intermediate species. Other morphological characteristics did not vary predictably with shade-tolerance rank. The maintenance of high specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area/leaf mass) and leaf area ratio (LAR; leaf area/sapling mass) is considered important for growth under extreme shade, yet these traits were not clearly related to the shade-tolerance rank of these species. Fraxinus americana, an intermediate species, had the highest LAR and growth rate in the understory, and with the exception of P. serotina, the very shade-tolerant A. saccharum had the lowest LAR. Prunus serotina maintained a large starch-rich tap root and shoot dieback was common, yielding the largest root/shoot ratio for these species. The observed allocation patterns were not similar to the long-standing expectation for the phenotypic response of juvenile trees to shade, but were consistent with three hypothetical "growth strategies" in the understory: (1) the low SLA and LAR of A. saccharum may provide a measure of defense against herbivores and pathogens and thus promote persistence in the understory, (2) the high SLA for F. americana and high LAR for F. americana and A. rubrum may enable these species to achieve high growth rates in shade, and (3) the large carbohydrate stores of P. serotina may poise this species for opportunistic growth following disturbance. The relative importance of resistance to herbivores and pathogens vs. the maintenance of high growth rates may be important in evaluating the patterns of biomass allocation in the understory.},

abstract = {1 We examined the validity of classifying tree species as early, mid-, or late-successional based on age and height-growth rates, by comparing the age and height-growth rates of trees in the boreal forest. 2 Age was first examined using the traditional method of coring 30 cm above the root collar; then dendrochronology was used to locate the root collar and missing annual growth rings. Traditional ageing differentially underestimates tree age; species classified as early successional (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Pinus banksiana) are less severely underestimated than those classified as mid- and late-successional (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea) (0-11 vs. 0-43 years), and also have relatively fewer locally missing growth rings. Ageing at the root collar shows that all tree species recruit within 5-10 years after fire and age cannot therefore be used to determine successional status. 3 Mean time taken to grow to each 1-m increment from the root collar was estimated for each species. Species classified as early successional have relatively higher growth rates between the root collar and the first metre; they are therefore less severely underestimated when aged above the root collar, explaining why they often appear older than species classified as mid- and late-successional. The lack of species differences above 1 m means that height-growth rates cannot be used to classify these tree species as early, mid-, or late-successional. 4 In the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, the rapid recruitment of all tree species after fire, and the short fire cycle mean that the forest dynamics between catastrophic wildfires are driven primarily by the mortality rates of each species.},

abstract = {1. The hypothesis that herbivory pressure (defined as the per cent of the photosynthetic tissue biomass and production consumed daily by herbivores) increases with increasing plant growth rate was tested. The basis for the test was a compilation of 56 published reports on biomass, production and herbivory, from a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial plant communities. 2. Herbivory was independent of ecosystem primary production and the fraction of plant production and biomass daily consumed by herbivores increased as the 0.6 and 1.6 power of plant turnover rate, respectively. 3. These results suggest that the tendency of fast-growing plants to support lower biomass of photosynthetic tissues than slow-growing ones can be accounted for by the tendency of herbivore control of plant biomass and production to increase with increasing plant growth rate. 4. It is concluded that herbivory should be most important as a control mechanism for fast-growing plant communities, whereas it represents but a modest percentage of losses of photosynthetic tissues of slow-growing plants.},

abstract = {Directional selection impacts a trait distribution by shifting its mean and reducing its variance. The change of variance is of major importance as the response to selection in subsequent generations is highly dependent of the genetic variability available in the population. In this contribution, evolution of genetic variation was investigated through the first breeding populations of the French maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) breeding program. We considered three populations: P0 (the forest where plus trees were initially selected), G0 (the plus tree population) and G1 (the population composed of trees selected in the progenies of G0). Analyses focused on the following selected traits: total height (H), girth at 1.30 m (D) and stem deviation to verticality (S). More than 150,000 trees from 25 tests of three distinct populations were studied with an individual genetic model. Accurate genetic parameters were obtained by taking all relationships between trees into account. For H and D, we found a strong decrease of the genetic variation from P0 to G0 corresponding to the initial selection of plus trees, which constitutes the base population of the breeding program. Then, despite the second step of selection applied, no appreciable evolution arose from comparisons between G0 and G1 for these traits. For S, the evolution is less significant as phenotypic variation slightly increased, possibly due to changes of silvicultural practices.},

abstract = {Eucalyptus species originating in Australian habitats differing in moisture regimes were examined under uniform growth conditions for their photosynthetic characteristics and allocation patterns. Species from the driest environments, the 'mallee' types, had the smallest leaf sizes and the highest leaf specific weights; and forest species, from moist coastal sites, had the largest and thinnest leaves. Photosynthetic rates on a dry weight basis were highly correlated with leaf nitrogen content in all species. Leaf nitrogen content on a dry weight basis varied little between species in nature; however, there were increasing amounts of nitrogen per unit leaf area as the habitat became drier because of the changes in specific leaf weight. This resulted in a greater light-saturated photosynthetic rate per leaf area of arid habitat species, which were presumably more efficient in water use as a consequence. A simple simulation model showed that changes in the allocation ratio to leaf weight reduces total leaf area in the expected direction without affecting total dry matter accumulation.},

I allowed seeds to germinate over a period of 500 days, and grew the seedlings in a greenhouse for 35 days prior to harvest. Cumulative percentage germination of six species approximated logistic curves. Species with larger seeds were more shade-tolerant, which resulted largely from greater biomass allocation to roots by these species. Seedlings of Rosa gymnocarpa, Sorbus scopulina, Symphoricarpos albus, Clintonia uniflora, and Streptopus amplexifolius grew larger in open sun than in shade (35% open sun), whereas those of Actaea rubra, Disporum trachycarpum, Smilacina racemosa, and Smilacina stellata showed no differences. Percentage root biomass was higher in sun than in shade for R. gymnocarpa, S. scopulina, S. albus, C. uniflora, and S. amplexifolius, but lower for S. stellata. In C. uniflora, S. racemosa, and S. stellata, seeds from unripe fruits failed to germinate. The results suggest that light gaps resulting from periodic disturbance of canopy influence recruitment of bird-dispersed species differentially and thereby contribute to maintaining high species richness and diversity in understories of temperate coniferous forests.},

abstract = {In order to better understand tree dynamics and maintenance of the ecotone between eastern deciduous forest and tallgrass prairie, I planted seedlings of five different species into a Cross Timbers area in North West Oklahoma for one-year. The seedlings were planted in four different patch-types under two different herbivore treatments. I found that (1) out of the original 200 seedlings, 58 survived after one-year with lacebark elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ), osage orange ( Maclura pomifera ), and eastern redbud ( Cercis canadensis ) surviving the most and protection from herbivores increasing survivorship by more than an order of magnitude, (2) elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) showed the slowest stem growth but protection from herbivory increased stem growth rate by approximately 50%, leaf area ratio was largest for elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) but seedlings growing in sumac ( Rhus copallina ) patches had the smallest values, specific leaf area was the largest for orange ( Maclura pomifera ) seedlings with tree seedlings growing in grass patches showing greater values than those grown in other patches, and (3) leaf mass ratio was largest for elm ( Ulmus parrifolia ) with seedlings grown in sumac ( Rhus copallina ) patches showing the smallest values and rough-leaf dogwood ( Cornus drummondii ) had the most root biomass relative to shoot biomass compared to all other species. Results suggest tree invasion and establishment across this ecotone is influenced both by species identity and by the variation in resources associated with the distribution and patch dynamics of vegetation from both eastern deciduous forest and tallgrass prairie.},

abstract = {Drought stress is the main cause of mortality of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) seedlings in forest plantations. We therefore assessed if drought hardening, applied in the nursery at the end of the growing season, enhanced the drought tolerance and transplanting performance of holm oak seedlings. Seedlings were subjected to three drought hardening intensities (low, moderate and severe) for 2.5 and 3.5 months, and compared with control seedlings. At the end of the hardening period, water relations, gas exchange and morphological attributes were determined, and survival and growth under mesic and xeric transplanting conditions were assessed. Drought hardening increased drought tolerance primarily by affecting physiological traits, with no effect on shoot/root ratio or specific leaf mass. Drought hardening reduced osmotic potential at saturation and at the turgor loss point, stomatal conductance, residual transpiration (RT) and new root growth capacity (RGC), but enhanced cell membrane stability. Among treated seedlings, the largest response occurred in seedlings subjected to moderate hardening. Severe hardening reduced shoot soluble sugar concentration and increased shoot starch concentration. Increasing the duration of hardening had no effect on water relations but reduced shoot mineral and starch concentrations. Variation in cell membrane stability, RT and RGC were negatively related to osmotic adjustment. Despite differences in drought tolerance, no differences in mortality and relative growth rate were observed between hardening treatments when the seedlings were transplanted under either mesic or xeric conditions.},

abstract = {1. Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant{\textendash}plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant{\textendash}plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition {\textendash} measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth {\textendash} varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. {4.Synthesis.} Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant{\textendash}plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant{\textendash}plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant{\textendash}plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Xylem vulnerability to cavitation is a promising criterion for identifying trees with high drought tolerance, but traditional techniques for measuring cavitation resistance are unsuitable for screening large numbers of genotypes. We tested the potential of the new Cavitron technique for high throughput screening of cavitation resistance in five poplar (Populus spp.) and four willow (Salix spp.) clones. The Cavitron technique enabled the screening of three to four clones per day with sufficient accuracy to reveal significant differences between clones. Because intraspecific screening may be better carried out through the identification of correlated and more easily measured traits, we attempted to identify accessible parameters that correlate to cavitation resistance. Variability in vulnerability to cavitation across clones was poorly correlated with anatomical traits such as vessel diameter, vessel wall strength, wood density and fiber wall thickness; however, a striking correlation was established between cavitation resistance and aboveground biomass production, indicating a possible trade-off between xylem safety and growth potential.},

abstract = {Time series of population density are often used to seek deviations from logistic regulation by testing for a non-linear decline in per capita growth rate with density. Here I show that this method fails when the interval between observations is not matched by the timing of density impacts on growth. Time series overestimate instantaneous density impacts at low density and underestimate them at high density. More generally, logistic growth produces a deterministically decelerating decline in per capita growth with density if the interval between measures of population size exceeds any lag in density response. Deceleration arises independently out of stochastic density fluctuations, and under-compensating regulation. These multiple influences lead to the conclusion that sequential density estimates provide insufficient information on their own to reveal the identity of non-logistic growth processes. They can yield estimates of density compensation, however, which may suggest time lags in density dependence. Analysis of an empirical time series illustrates the issues.},

One hypothesis used to explain this allocation is that plants optimize their behaviour by maximizing their relative growth rate. The consequences of this hypothesis were investigated by formulating two models for root : shoot allocation, with and without explicit inclusion of maintenance respiration. The models also took into account that relative growth rate is a linear function of plant nitrogen concentration. The model without respiration gave qualitatively reasonable results when predictions were compared with observed results from growth experiments with birch and tomato. The explicit inclusion of maintenance respiration improved considerably the agreement between prediction and observation, and for birch was within the experimental accuracy. Further improvements will require additional details in the description of respiratory processes and the nitrogen uptake function. Plants growing under extreme nutrient stress may also optimize their behaviour with respect to other variables in addition to relative growth rate.},

The competitive strategy prevails in productive, relatively undisturbed vegetation, the stress-tolerant strategy is associated with continuously unproductive conditions, and the ruderal strategy is characteristic of severely disturbed but potentially productive habitats. A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that shape the distribution of tropical tree species at large scales is a central issue in ecology, conservation and forest management. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the importance of environmental factors relative to historical factors for tree species distributions in the semi-evergreen forests of the northern Congo basin; and to (ii) identify potential mechanisms explaining distribution patterns through a trait-based approach. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the distribution patterns of 31 common tree species in an area of more than 700,000 km(2) spanning the borders of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo using forest inventory data from 56,445 0.5-ha plots. Spatial variation of environmental (climate, topography and geology) and historical factors (human disturbance) were quantified from maps and satellite records. Four key functional traits (leaf phenology, shade tolerance, wood density, and maximum growth rate) were extracted from the literature. The geological substrate was of major importance for the distribution of the focal species, while climate and past human disturbances had a significant but lesser impact. Species distribution patterns were significantly related to functional traits. Species associated with sandy soils typical of sandstone and alluvium were characterized by slow growth rates, shade tolerance, evergreen leaves, and high wood density, traits allowing persistence on resource-poor soils. In contrast, fast-growing pioneer species rarely occurred on sandy soils, except for Lophira alata. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate strong environmental filtering due to differential soil resource availability across geological substrates. Additionally, long-term human disturbances in resource-rich areas may have accentuated the observed patterns of species and trait distributions. Trait differences across geological substrates imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for different conservation and management strategies.},

abstract = {Short rotation coppices (SRC) are often established by inserting cuttings vertically into the soil. Longer cuttings are generally regarded as superior to establish plants on stress-prone sites. However, knowledge about above- and belowground biomass production, plant allometry and root characteristic of clones established through different lengths of cuttings is scarce. The experiment was performed with 2 common SRC clones (Populus clone Max 4, Salix clone Inger) and 2 cutting length (20~cm and 40~cm). Above- and belowground biomass and leaf and root morphology were determined after one growing season. Longer cuttings produce more biomass but have a diverging influence on the shoot:root allocation of both clones. Long cuttings of Populus cl. Max produce more aboveground biomass, mostly leaves, than 20~cm cuttings, while 40~cm Salix cl. Inger cuttings have more fine roots. Leaf and root morphology are only marginally influenced by cutting length. Choosing longer Populus cl. Max cuttings might not be a good strategy when considering SRC establishment on more stress-prone sites, since their larger above-ground biomass will e.g. increase transpirational demand. Because of the lower shoot:root ratio, longer Salix cl. Inger cuttings seem to be more suitable to establish SRC on fields with (partially) restricted water and nutrient supply than shorter cuttings. Thus, planting difficulties and higher costs of longer cuttings may be offset by higher survival and greater aboveground productivity only in some clones. In the future, optimal cutting lengths must be evaluated not only for different environmental conditions but also for different SRC species/clones.},

abstract = {The effect of CO2 enrichment on the growth and the economy of carbon and nitrogen of 11 Mediterranean grass species was investigated in order to determine the underlying causes of the large variation observed between species in their responses to elevated CO2. Plants were grown for 26-43 d (depending on species growth rate) under productive conditions at ambient (350 $\mu$mol mol-1) and elevated (700 $\mu$mol mol-1) concentrations of CO2. Plant parameters were determined at a common biomass of 0.15 g to determine the CO2 effect independent of ontogenic effects. The effect of CO2 on RGR ranged from -6.7 to 22.5 %, with a mean stimulation of 10.3 %. Averaged over the 11 species, the growth enhancement resulted from an increase in net assimilation rate per unit leaf d. wt. (NARw) of 10.6 %. This was the result of a large increase (18.7 %) in NAR per unit leaf area (NARa) associated with a 8.1 % decrease in the specific leaf area (SLA). This decrease in SLA was due to a large increase of the non-structural carbohydrates. The increase in shoot activity was balanced by a 7.6 % increase in the specific absorption rate of nitrogen (SAR). As a result, plant nitrogen content was not modified. Leaf nitrogen productivity was significantly increased (14.9%). Shoot vs. root allocation of biomass and nitrogen was not modified. An analysis across the 11 species of the relationships between the stimulation of RGR and the alteration in RGR components showed a significant correlation only with increases in NARw, SAR and nitrogen productivity. The co-ordinated increase in these three parameters constitutes a single response syndrome, whose intensity is responsible for most of the species variability.},

Resource availability in the environment is proposed as the major determinant of both the amount and type of plant defense. When resource are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses. Leaf lifetime, also determined by resource availability, affects the relative advantages of defenses with different turnover rates. Relative limitation of different resources also constrains the types of defenses. The proposals are compared with other theories on the evolution of plant defenses.},

abstract = {Seedling relative growth rate ({RGR)} achieved under favourable growth conditions can be thought of as a useful bioassay of the potential ability of species to take advantage of favourable growth opportunities; that is, of a species' growth strategy. The consistency of relationships between {RGR} and its component attributes leaf nitrogen productivity ({LNP)}, leaf N per area ({LNCa)}, specific leaf area ({SLA)} and leaf mass ratio ({LMR)} was assessed across 12 datasets comprising three growth forms (grasses, herbaceous dicots and woody plants; 250 species in total). These relationships were characterised in terms of scaling slopes (regressions on log-log axes, the slopes giving the proportional relationship between the variables). Mathematically, the expected scaling slope between {RGR} and each component is 1.0, giving an appropriate null hypothesis to test against (whereas the widely used null hypothesis of zero correlation is in fact inappropriate for this situation). Deviations below 1:1 scaling slopes indicate negative covariance between the components. Consequently, the correlation structure between the components of {RGR} should also be investigated. Biologically, {RGR} should scale 1:1 with {SLA} at a given {LNCa} and somewhat more weakly with {LNCa} at a given {SLA.} {SLA} and {LNCa} should themselves scale with a slope of between 0 and -1, with the actual slope indicating the extent to which between-species variation in {SLA} dilutes leaf N on an area basis versus the ability of species to maintain {LNCa} at a given growth irradiance. On average, across the 12 datasets {RGR} scaled close-to-proportionally with {SLA}, and 1:1 with {SLA} at a given {LNCa.} {RGR} scaled with {LNCa} with null or negative slopes, since {SLA} and {LNCa} scaled negatively (with slopes generally shallower than -1); however, {RGR} scaled positively (but less than proportionally) with {LNCa} at a given {SLA.} For these key relationships there were no qualitatively different conclusions with respect to the growth form under consideration or the growth irradiance at which the seedlings were grown. {RGR} also scaled close-to-proportionally with {LNP}, while {LNP} and {LNCa} were negatively associated. These relationships involving {LNP} are difficult to interpret since it can be shown that they are, at least potentially, the result of the interactions between {RGR}, {SLA} and {LNCa}, as well as reflecting intrinsic differences in the efficiency of nitrogen use in the growth process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Inevitable trade-offs in structure may be a basis for differentiation in plant strategies. Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.

METHODS:The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1-1.5 m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis (PCA), respectively. The correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size.

KEY RESULTS:The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size.

CONCLUSIONS:Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.},

abstract = {A 4-year fertilization experiment with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) was carried out in natural gaps of a subtropical forest in northeastern Argentina. Saplings of six dominant canopy species differing in shade tolerance were grown in five control and five N + P fertilized gaps. Hydraulic architectural traits such as wood density, the leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA : SA), vulnerability to cavitation (P50) and specific and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity were measured, as well as the relative growth rate, specific leaf area (SLA) and percentage of leaf damage by insect herbivores. Plant growth rates and resistance to drought-induced embolisms increased when nutrient limitations were removed. On average, the P50 of control plants was -1.1 MPa, while the P50 of fertilized plants was -1.6 MPa. Wood density and LA : SA decreased with N + P additions. A trade-off between vulnerability to cavitation and efficiency of water transport was not observed. The relative growth rate was positively related to the total leaf surface area per plant and negatively related to LA : SA, while P50 was positively related to SLA across species and treatments. Plants with higher growth rates and higher total leaf area in fertilized plots were able to avoid hydraulic dysfunction by becoming less vulnerable to cavitation (more negative P50). Two high-light-requiring species exhibited relatively low growth rates due to heavy herbivore damage. Contrary to expectations, shade-tolerant plants with relatively high resistance to hydraulic dysfunction and reduced herbivory damage were able to grow faster. These results suggest that during the initial phase of sapling establishment in gaps, species that were less vulnerable to cavitation and exhibited reduced herbivory damage had faster realized growth rates than less shade-tolerant species with higher potential growth rates. Finally, functional relationships between hydraulic traits and growth rate across species and treatments were maintained regardless of soil nutrient status.},

abstract = {1 We tested whether seedlings of small-seeded species were more reliant on soil nutrients than large-seeded ones by growing 21 species from three woody genera (Eucalyptus, Hakea and Banksia) along a gradient of nutrient availability. 2 At very low nutrient availability, larger seeds produced larger seedlings. This was seen especially among the eucalypts, but the difference was eliminated at optimal soil nutrient levels. Hakea species with large seed mass, and all Banksia species, appeared unable to exploit additional soil nutrients for growth, whatever the level supplied. 3 Larger seeds tended to have proportionately higher contents of N, P and K and, under nutrient-poor conditions, supplied more of these to their seedlings, although at a diminishing rate. 4 We suggest that large-seededness could be an adaptation to the high-light, nutrient-impoverished habitats in which these species occur by providing the seedling with the mineral nutrients, rather than carbon-based metabolites, needed for maximizing initial root growth. Reaching reliable moisture before summer (drought avoidance) is an alternative strategy to physiological tolerance of drought.},

abstract = {Abstract A range of traits, including metabolic costs, biomass allocation and seed reserves, may contribute to interspecific variation in the shade tolerance of tree seedlings. In addition, shade tolerance may be affected by differential responses of species to soil resource availability at low light. We used a custom-built whole-plant gas-exchange chamber to quantify instantaneous whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP) and to parameterize whole-plant daily C gain models for seedlings of eight temperate deciduous tree species. We examined the relationship of WPLCP to growth, biomass allocation and gas-exchange under high and low light and nutrient availabilities and compared it to WPCLP of naturally recruited saplings. For species showing a response, both increased light and nutrient availability resulted in increased WPLCP. However, species{\textquoteright} responses to resource availability did not correspond closely with shade tolerance as has generally been predicted. Variation in WPLCP within species was best predicted by whole-plant dark respiration rates, leaf-level light compensation point and leaf mass per area. Among species, seed size was a strong negative correlate of WPLCP, explaining 66% of the variation. Species with the lowest WPLCP maintained lower growth rates across treatments but greater biomass in the low-light treatment compared with more light-demanding species. These data suggest that a number of traits, in particular metabolic costs and seed size, contribute to WPLCP. However, gas-exchange-based WPLCP was 1.5{\textendash}3.5 times lower than corresponding growth-based field estimates of WPLCP, suggesting that other factors such as biotic interactions or ontogenetic shifts in whole-plant light requirements may substantially increase species{\textquoteright} WPLCP under natural conditions.},

abstract = {The evolution of intrinsic growth rate has received less attention than other life history traits, and has been studied differently in plants, homoiotherms, and poikilotherms. The benefits of rapid growth are obvious, so the problem is to explain the costs and tradeoffs that cause organisms to grow below their physiological maximum. Four prevailing themes emerge from the literature: (1) slow growth is adaptive for dealing with nutrient stress, (2) the tradeoff between growth rate and development limits growth in species that require mature function early in life, (3) rapid growth evolves when a minimum size must be reached quickly, such as for sexual maturation or overwintering, and (4) rapid growth may evolve to compensate for slowed growth owing to environmental conditions. Evidence for each of these themes is detailed for plants, homoiotherms, and poikilotherms. In addition, empirical evidence is reviewed for costs of rapid growth, including increased fluctuating asymmetry, reduced immune capacity, and reduced ability to respond to environmental stress.},

Seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and measures of invasiveness were positively associated across species as well as within phylogenetically independent contrasts. High RGR, small seed masses, and short generation times characterize pine species that are successful invaders in disturbed habitats. Discriminant analysis and logistic regression revealed that RGR was the most significant factor among these life-history traits separating invasive and noninvasive species. We also explored the causes of differences in RGR among invasive and noninvasive species. While net assimilation rate, leaf mass ratio, and specific leaf area (SLA) were all found to be contributing positively to RGR, SLA was found to be the main component responsible for differences in RGR between invasive and noninvasive pines. We investigated differences in SLA further by studying leaf anatomy, leaf density, and leaf thickness. We also evaluated relative leaf production rate as an important aspect of SLA. We proposed a hypothetical causal network of all relevant variables.},

abstract = {Identifying the biological determinants of range limits of trees is an unsolved problem of critical importance for predicting the effects of climate change on forests. Data showing that many boreal trees can grow in temperate climates indicate that southern range limits do not necessarily result from excessive temperature per se. A growth tradeoff could exist between freezing tolerance and height growth rate if adaptations to tolerate cold climates interfered with growth. Analysis of height growth rate versus freezing tolerance for twenty-two North American trees provided evidence for such a tradeoff. Provenance trials of numerous tree species also showed that a tradeoff exists within species, indicating a genetic basis for these traits. The result of this tradeoff is that at their southern range margins most species do not suffer from too much heat but rather face competitors with a faster growth rate. The implication for future climate change is that forests will not suffer catastrophic dieback due to increased temperatures but will rather be replaced gradually by faster growing types, perhaps over hundreds of years.},

abstract = {Plant developmental responses to shade are the combination of reductions in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and changes in spectral quality (reductions in the quantum ratio of red to far-red band widths, R:FR). We studied the seedling development of six Asian tropical rain forest trees, Dryobalanops aromatica, Endospermum malaccense, Hopea wightiana, Parkia javanica, Shorea singkawang, and Sindora echinocalyx under varying PPFD and R:FR. Seedlings were grown in replicated shadehouse treatments: (1) 40% solar PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (2) 11% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (3) 11% PPFD and 0.24 R:FR; (4) 3% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; and (5) 3% PPFD and 0.23 R:FR. Species differed in the influence of light variables on seedling (1) total height; (2) internode distance; (3) branch to trunk internodes; (4) stem length/mass; (5) leaf area/stem length; (6) percent allocation to leaf, stem and root mass; (7) specific leaf mass; (8) mean leaf area; (9) leaf thickness; (10) petiole length; and (11) stomatal density. The simple factorial design of treatments 2--5 allowed a two-way ANOVA and the calculation of coefficients of determination of the treatment effects. The characters in most taxa were primarily influenced by light intensity, but spectral quality also influenced characters in many cases. The taxa that responded most strongly to the light treatments were the most shade-intolerant: E. malaccense and P. javanica; the former species responded strongly to R:FR, particularly in stem mass allocation and leaf area/stem length. The four taxa with moderate-to-extreme shade tolerance varied considerably in responses of individual characters to R:FR and PPFD. The patterns of morphological responses to reduced PPFD and R:FR help explain how the shade tolerances of the seedlings of rain forest trees vary in a continuous manner. Recommendations concerning seedling shade tolerance for sylviculture or nursery practice may need revision if they were based on shade trials using spectrally neutral shade fabrics or slat houses. Future research on the effects of shading on tree seedling development and ecology must consider the potential influence of changes in spectral quality under canopy shade.},

abstract = {Traditional rankings of shade tolerance of trees make little reference to individual size. However, greater respiratory loads with increasing sapling size imply that larger individuals will be less able to tolerate shade than smaller individuals of the same species and that there may be shifts among species in shade tolerance with size. We tested this hypothesis using maximum likelihood estimation to develop individual-tree-based models of the probability of mortality as a function of recent growth rate for seven species: trembling aspen, paper birch, yellow birch, mountain maple, white spruce, balsam fir and eastern white cedar. Shade tolerance of small individuals, as quantified by risk of mortality at low growth, was mostly consistent with traditional shade tolerance rankings such that cedar�{\&}gt;�balsam fir�{\&}gt;�white spruce�{\&}gt;�yellow birch�{\&}gt;�mountain maple�=�paper birch�{\&}gt;�aspen. Differences in growth-dependent mortality were greatest between species in the smallest size classes. With increasing size, a reduced tolerance to shade was observed for all species except trembling aspen and thus species tended to converge in shade tolerance with size. At a given level of radial growth larger trees, apart from aspen, had a higher probability of mortality than smaller trees. Successional processes associated with shade tolerance may thus be most important in the seedling stage and decrease with ontogeny. Journal of Ecology (2005)doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01070.x},

We examined patterns of growth and mortality among shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and survival rates across species. 2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight. 3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2% daylight showed no significant relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR M ) in 0.8% and 10% light. 4 The RGR M values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR M was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR M was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass). 5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have important implications for},

abstract = {Likely tree growth responses to climate change remain a controversial issue, in part because these responses may differ across biomes and forest communities. In the Mediterranean basin {\textendash} one of the most vulnerable regions according to climatic change scenarios {\textendash} there are experimental and modelling evidences of both positive and negative tree growth responses to warming temperatures: i.e. warmer temperatures can be positive for tree growth whenever a higher evapotranspirational demand does not imply a significant stress due to water scarcity. In this study we examine the relationship between last century drought events and growth patterns in inland-dune managed pinelands in the Iberian Peninsula. We used decadal growth measurements recorded in harvested trees belonging to a chronosequence of managed forest stands along the XX century. As relevant climatic predictors we considered mean temperature, mean precipitation and three indices based on the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (i.e. mean water balance, frequency of dry years and the most severe drought event in the decade). Results support that the final outcome of climate change on forest productivity would critically depend more on unusual frequency of dry years than on mean temperature, precipitation or water balance. However this pattern can greatly vary with population-level structural factors such as population age distribution and competition, i.e. negative impacts of increasing drought frequency are disproportionally higher in younger trees under high competition. These results suggest two adaptive measures to concomitant climatic changes; (i) lengthening the rotation period to enhance forest resistance to drought due to lower vulnerability of older trees and, (ii) promoting stand heterogeneity (i.e. size and age unevenness) with a gradient in shade conditions to decrease competition and increase recruitment opportunities during benign periods.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Competition between siblings affect their growth and survival ability. An extreme situation is polyembryony, whereby siblings are exposed to competition from the beginning of their development. But its effect on plant reproduction is seldom tested. Eriotheca pubescens is a tree in the Cerrado, the Neotropical Savannas in Brazil, with apomictic/polyembryonic and sexual/monoembryonic populations. We tested the effect of polyembryony on germination, emergence, and growth in E. pubescens. This may have ecological consequences within the Cerrado, where seedling establishment is critical for species persistency and distribution. METHODS: We tested the effect of embryonic origin on germinability- and time-related parameters using seeds from different populations. We measured cultivated seedling growth continuously for 70 d and exhumed them after 9 mo to measure seedling biometry traits such as shoot, root, and seedling mass. We compared these traits with the number of seedlings emerged per seed and fitted data to a linear regression model. KEY RESULTS: Polyembryony reduced germinability and seedlings' initial growth in E. pubescens. Seedling traits and biomass decreased with the number of seedlings arising per seed. But the effect of polyembryony was mostly on initial seedling size and not on seedling growth rate. CONCLUSIONS: Polyembryony and apomixis affected germination and led to smaller seedlings compared with monoembryonic sexual counterparts. Although smaller, these extra seedlings may enhance per-seed survival chances in the Cerrado conditions of seasonal drought and frequent fires and explain the predominance of polyembryonic populations.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits control a variety of terrestrial ecosystem processes, including soil carbon storage which is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Plant traits regulate net soil carbon storage by controlling carbon assimilation, its transfer and storage in belowground biomass, and its release from soil through respiration, fire and leaching. However, our mechanistic understanding of these processes is incomplete. Here, we present a mechanistic framework, based on the plant traits that drive soil carbon inputs and outputs, for understanding how alteration of vegetation composition will affect soil carbon sequestration under global changes. First, we show direct and indirect plant trait effects on soil carbon input and output through autotrophs and heterotrophs, and through modification of abiotic conditions, which need to be considered to determine the local carbon sequestration potential. Second, we explore how the composition of key plant traits and soil biota related to carbon input, release and storage prevail in different biomes across the globe, and address the biome-specific mechanisms by which plant trait composition may impact on soil carbon sequestration. We propose that a trait-based approach will help to develop strategies to preserve and promote carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Although the potential contribution to tropical tree species coexistence of niche differentiation along light gradients has received much attention, the degree to which species perform differentially along soil resource gradients remains unclear. To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6.0% of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mg P kg{\textminus}1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differed markedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate, suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across a wide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments.},

The West African tree species Albizia zygia, Blighia sapida, Celtis mildbraedii, Chrysophyllum pruniforme, Cynometra ananta, Guarea cedrata, Heritiera utilis, Lophira alata, Mansonia altissima, Milicia excelsa, Pericopsis elata, Pterygota macrocarpa, Strombosia glaucescens, Terminalia ivorensis and Triplochiton scleroxylon, which represent different ecological guilds (pioneers, non-pioneer light-demanders and non-pioneer shade-bearers) and distributions on a rainfall and soil fertility gradient were tested for their response to differences in irradiance and soil fertility. 2. Seedlings were grown for 4 months at a common site on contrasting forest soils from a wet evergreen forest and a moist semi-deciduous forest and at five irradiances, which mimicked variation in irradiance from single tree falls to cleared land. 3. Pioneer species responded differently to irradiance by showing higher maximum relative growth rates (>30 mg g<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) and unit leaf rates (>3.0 g m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) than non-pioneer shade-bearers (<22 mg g<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> and <2.1 g m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Particularly at the irradiance level below 8% of ambient, pioneers also showed higher leaf area ratios (>220 cm g<sup>-1</sup>) and specific leaf areas (>400 cm g<sup>-1</sup>) compared to shade-bearers. Non-pioneer light-demanders showed intermediate responses to differences in irradiance. 4. The soil from the wet evergreen forest was more acid (pH <tex-math>$\leg$</tex-math> 4.87) than the soil from moist semi-deciduous forest (pH $\ge$ 6.12). It also had lower concentrations of total N and available P, K, Ca and Mn, particularly in the topsoil. Seedlings grown in wet evergreen forest soil showed reduced leaf foliar concentrations of P, Ca and Mg and to a lesser extent N, compared with those grown in moist semi-deciduous forest soil, but the response varied between species. Foliar nutrient concentrations, particularly of P and Mg, were lowest in species naturally restricted to wet evergreen forest. 5. The non-pioneer light-demander Mansonia altissima and the pioneer T. scleroxylon showed an increase of 300% and 100%, respectively, in maximum RGR when grown in the more fertile soil type. In contrast, RGR of the pioneer L. alata was increased by 80% in the less fertile soil. Species-specific differences in growth response, biomass allocation and foliar nutrient concentration may explain why some species are restricted to more fertile soils. Suggestions for further research are made.},

abstract = {Mediterranean woody plants exhibit a wide phenological diversity which cannot be explained just on the basis of climatic constraints. We assessed the role of relative growth rate (RGR), life form, seed and fruit mass as potential constraints of plant phenology. In a comparison of traits of 22 Mediterranean woody plant species, the duration of the primary shoot growing period decreased from climbers to shrubs and to trees. A hypothesised negative association between RGR and primary shoot growth duration did not emerge in our species set. The mechanism underlying phenological differences between plant life forms might relate to differences in the proportion of respiring to photosynthetic tissues, which decreases from climbers to trees. It is suggested that the degree of shoot preformation within the bud correlates with primary shoot growth duration, but not with RGR. Development of big fruits and seeds competes for carbon with vegetative growth. Indeed, species with bigger seeds and fruits exhibited shorter primary shoot growing periods, which tended to overlap with flower bud formation and flowering periods. We suggest that duration of primary shoot growth allow to short out the species between two extreme growth strategies: The conservative one would be characterised by a concentration of the primary shoot growth into a short period, free of frosts and droughts, and by a diversion of part of the current resources to assure next year's growth. The opportunistic strategy, on the other extreme, would be defined by the allocation of resources to current growth whenever they are available, achieving longer growing periods at the expense of higher risk of tissue damage. These strategies should have been selected for in environments of predictable and unpredictable resource availability, respectively.},

Newly germinated seedlings of six tree and shrub species with very small seeds (31-460 $\mu$ g dry mass), one light-demanding and five shade-tolerant at the stage of establishment in the wild, were grown for 5 months in neutral shade houses with 0.5, 1, 3.5 and 7.5% daylight. 2. The ratio of yield in 7.5% to that in 1% was 8:1 for the light-demanding Melastoma malabathricum but only 2:1 for the confamilial shade-tolerator Pternandra echinata. The Pternandra, Urophyllum hirsutum, Ficus chartacea, Ficus grossularioides and Pellacalyx saccardianus showed a graded series of responses to irradiance, generally consistent with their apparent demands for light in the wild. In contrast, survival of very deep shade was not clearly related to light demand in nature. 3. The results support the conclusion drawn from observational studies that large seed size is not primarily adaptive in resisting shade but in resisting the associated risks of burial by litter, desiccation during dry spells, uprooting by birds and other kinds of damage by animals or falling debris.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Leaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival. Methods Data from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from 1994 to 2011. Key Results Median leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to {\textgreater}1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115{\textendash}867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits. Conclusions The wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys.

abstract = {Recent large-scale studies of tree growth in the Iberian Peninsula reported contrasting positive and negative effects of temperature in Mediterranean angiosperms and conifers. Here we review the different hypotheses that may explain these trends and propose that the observed contrasting responses of tree growth to temperature in this region could be associated with a continuum of trait differences between angiosperms and conifers. Angiosperm and conifer trees differ in the effects of phenology in their productivity, in their growth allometry, and in their sensitivity to competition. Moreover, angiosperms and conifers significantly differ in hydraulic safety margins, sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), xylem recovery capacity or the rate of carbon transfer. These differences could be explained by key features of the xylem such as non-structural carbohydrate content (NSC), wood parenchymal fraction or wood capacitance. We suggest that the reviewed trait differences define two contrasting ecophysiological strategies that may determine qualitatively different growth responses to increased temperature and drought. Improved reciprocal common garden experiments along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients would be key to quantify the relative importance of the different hypotheses reviewed. Finally, we show that warming impacts in this area occur in an ecological context characterized by the advance of forest succession and increased dominance of angiosperm trees over extensive areas. In this context, we examined the empirical relationships between the responses of tree growth to temperature and hydraulic safety margins in angiosperm and coniferous trees. Our findings suggest a future scenario in Mediterranean forests characterized by contrasting demographic responses in conifer and angiosperm trees to both temperature and forest succession, with increased dominance of angiosperm trees, and particularly negative impacts in pines.},

abstract = {Understanding climatic controls on tropical forest productivity is key to developing more reliable models for predicting how tropical biomes may respond to climate change. Currently there is no consensus on which factors control seasonal changes in tropical forest tree growth. This study reports the first comprehensive plot-level description of the seasonality of growth in a Peruvian tropical forest. We test whether seasonal and interannual variations in climate are correlated with changes in biomass increment, and whether such relationships differ among trees with different functional traits. We found that biomass increments, measured every 3 months on the two plots, were reduced by between 40 and 55% in the peak dry season (July-September) relative to peak wet season (January-March). The seasonal patterns of biomass accumulation are significantly (p < 0.01) associated with seasonal patterns of rainfall and soil water content; however, this may reflect a synchrony of seasonal cycles rather than direct physiological controls on tree growth rates. The strength of the growth seasonality response among trees is significantly correlated to functional traits: consistent with a hypothesised trade-off between maximum potential growth rate and hydraulic safety, tall and fast-growing trees with broad stems had the most strongly seasonal biomass accumulation, suggesting that they are more productive in the wet season, but more vulnerable to water limitation in the dry season.},

abstract = {Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting trade-off possibilities. The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.},

abstract = {The subject of this review is the impact of long-term changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between temperature-mediated changes in net assimilation rates (NAR) and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area (SLA)] when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of temperature-mediated changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining NAR values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in RGR, SLA, and NAR than slow-growing plants. For RGR and NAR, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i.e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater temperature-mediated changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, SLA was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in NAR account for an increasing proportion of variability in RGR as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, SLA played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in RGR at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of SLA in determining interspecific variation in RGR could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future.},

The species vary in their mean dry weight of seed from 1.9 mg to 686 mg. (2) High and synchronous germination occurs in both sun and shade for sixteen of the eighteen species. Most species have ephippia germination with leafy green cotyledons. (3) Seedlings of fifteen species survive better in sun than shade; none survive better in shade than sun. Survival in shade and in sun are positively correlated. Shade tolerance varies widely and continuously among the species; it correlates with adult wood density, an indicator of growth rate and successional status, but not with the dry weight of seed reserves. The more shade-tolerant species have a lower proportion of seedlings drynig from disease in the shade. (4) Seedling height after 1 year is greater in sun than in shade for all species. In both sun and shade, growth rate and height at 1 year are not correlated with adult wood density or shade tolerance. Seed dry weight correlates with seedling height in both sun and shade at 4 weeks, but with height in shade only at 1 year. Seedlings in shade show no or slow growth after the initial growth has used the seed reserves. (5) In the state, number and length of leaves show little or no change with time; leaf turnover is negligible. In the sun, leaf number increases and successively younger leaves mature at larger sizes. Leaf size is greater in the dune than in the shade. Senescence of the leafy cotyledons is more rapid in sun than shade for all species. (6) This experimental study predicts that all species examined benefit from seed dispersal to light-gaps. Some species are restricted as seedlings to gaps, while others persist, but do not grow appreciably, in the shaded understory. The implications of these differences in light requirements for the size-age structure and for the spatial pattern of the populations are discussed.},

abstract = {The relationships of 16 leaf traits and their plasticity with the dependence of tree species on gaps for regeneration (gap association index; GAI) were examined in a Neotropical rainforest. Young saplings of 24 species with varying GAI were grown under a closed canopy, in a medium-sized and in a large gap, thus capturing the full range of plasticity with respect to canopy openness. Structural, biomechanical, chemical and photosynthetic traits were measured. At the chloroplast level, the chlorophyll a/b ratio and plasticity in this variable were not related to the GAI. However, plasticity in total carotenoids per unit chlorophyll was larger in shade-tolerant species. At the leaf level, leaf mass per unit area (LMA) decreased with the GAI under the closed canopy and in the medium gap, but did not significantly decrease with the GAI in the large gap. This was a reflection of the larger plasticity in LMA and leaf thickness of gap-dependent species. The well-known opposite trends in LMA for adaptation and acclimation to high irradiance in evergreen tropical trees were thus not invariably found. Although leaf strength was dependent on LMA and thickness, plasticity in this trait was not related to the GAI. Photosynthetic capacity expressed on each basis increased with the GAI, but the large plasticity in these traits was not clearly related to the GAI. Although gap-dependent species tended to have a greater plasticity overall, as evident from a principle component analysis, leaf traits of gap-dependent species are thus not invariably more phenotypically plastic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain variation in leaf size, the mechanism underlying the variation remains not fully understood. To help understand leaf size variation, the cost/benefit of twig size was analysed, since, according to Corner's rule, twig size is positively correlated with the size of appendages the twig bears.

METHODS:An extensive survey of twig functional traits, including twig (current-year shoots including one stem and few leaves) and leaf size (individual leaf area and mass), was conducted for 234 species from four broadleaved forests. The scaling relationship between twig mass and leaf area was determined using standardized major axis regression and phylogenetic independent comparative analyses.

KEY RESULTS:Leaf area was found to scale positively and allometrically with both stem and twig mass (stem mass plus leaf mass) with slopes significantly smaller than 1.0, independent of life form and habitat type. Thus, the leaf area ratio (the ratio of total leaf area to stem or twig mass) decreases with increasing twig size. Moreover, the leaf area ratio correlated negatively with individual leaf mass. The results of phylogenetic independent comparativeanalyses were consistent with the correlations. Based on the above results, a simple model for twig size optimization was constructed, from which it is postulated that large leaf size-twig size may be favoured when leaf photosynthetic capacity is high and/or when leaf life span and/or stem longevity are long. The model's predictions are consistent with leaf size variation among habitats, in which leaf size tends to be small in poor habitats with a low primary productivity. The model also explains large variations in leaf size within habitats for which leaf longevity and stem longevity serve as important determinants.

CONCLUSIONS:The diminishing returns in the scaling of total leaf area with twig size can be explained in terms of a very simple model on twig siz},

abstract = {Trees grow tall where resources are abundant, stresses are minor, and competition for light places a premium on height growth. The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120 m in the absence of mechanical damage, but there are historical accounts of taller trees. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122-130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

abstract = {We investigated how water transport capacity, wood density and wood anatomy were related to leaf photosynthetic traits in two lowland forests in Panama. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity ( k(L)) of upper branches was positively correlated with maximum rates of net CO(2) assimilation per unit leaf area ( A(area)) and stomatal conductance ( g(s)) across 20 species of canopy trees. Maximum k(L) showed stronger correlation with A(area) than initial k(L) suggesting that allocation to photosynthetic potential is proportional to maximum water transport capacity. Terminal branch k(L) was negatively correlated with A(area)/ g(s) and positively correlated with photosynthesis per unit N, indicating a trade-off of efficient use of water against efficient use of N in photosynthesis as water transport efficiency varied. Specific hydraulic conductivity calculated from xylem anatomical characteristics ( k(theoretical)) was positively related to A(area) and k(L), consistent with relationships among physiological measurements. Branch wood density was negatively correlated with wood water storage at saturation, k(L), A(area), net CO(2) assimilation per unit leaf mass ( A(mass)), and minimum leaf water potential measured on covered leaves, suggesting that wood density constrains physiological function to specific operating ranges. Kinetic and static indices of branch water transport capacity thus exhibit considerable co-ordination with allocation to potential carbon gain. Our results indicate that understanding tree hydraulic architecture provides added insights to comparisons of leaf level measurements among species, and links photosynthetic allocation patterns with branch hydraulic processes.},

abstract = {Most knowledge of the physiological correlates of interspecific variation in shade tolerance derives from studies of first-year seedlings in artificial environments. The present study relates growth, allocation, foliage turnover, biomass distribution and gas exchange traits to low-light survival of large seedlings (20-100 cm tall) of eight temperate rainforest evergreens under field conditions. Taxa for which natural mortality was not observed in low light during the 14-month study are referred to here as "shade-tolerant" species, and those which did die in the shade are referred to as "light-demanding" species. In low light (2-5% canopy openness), shade-tolerant species had slightly lower light compensation points than light-demanders. Light-demanding species had more plastic aboveground allocation patterns, generally allocating proportionally less aboveground biomass to foliage production than shade-tolerant associates in high light (10% canopy openness), but more in low light. Foliage turnover was generally much slower in shade-tolerant species (10-40% year-1) than in light-demanding species (30-190%). As these differences in leaf retention outweighed variation in allocation, shade-tolerant species displayed higher leaf areas at all light levels. Furthermore, all shade-tolerant species gained leaf area in low light during the study period, whereas light-demanding taxa showed leaf area declines. Higher leaf area ratios, plus differences in light compensation points, indicate that large seedlings of shade-tolerant evergreens enjoy net carbon gain advantages over light-demanding associates in low light. However, minimal growth rate differences in low light imply higher storage allocation in shade-tolerant species. This study provides a rather different picture from that which has emerged from recent reviews of first-year seedling data, illustrating the longterm consequences of foliage turnover differences for biomass distribution, and suggesting that shade tolerance in juvenile evergreen trees is associated with a suite of traits which enhance net carbon gain, but not growth, in low light. Accumulation of a large foliage area through long leaf retention times is probably a key mechanism enhancing low-light carbon gain in evergreens.},

abstract = {Plant species differ widely in their rate of biomass production, even when grown under optimal conditions. A key question concerns the extent to which these growth rates correlate with the uptake of carbon and nitrogen and with the biomass allocation between leaves and roots. Recent data show that the answer to this question differs for mono- and dicotyledons, and that more than biomass allocation, it is the ratio between the activities of leaves and roots that correlates with the growth rate of a plant.},

abstract = {The dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa Yi), growing understory in subalpine dark coniferous forest, is one of the main foods for giant panda, and it influences the regeneration of subalpine coniferous forests in southwestern China. To investigate the effects of elevated CO₂, temperature and their combination, the dwarf bamboo plantlets were exposed to two CO₂ regimes (ambient and double ambient CO₂ concentration) and two temperatures (ambient and +2.2{\textdegree}C) in growth chambers. Gas exchange, leaf traits and carbohydrates concentration were measured after the 150-day experiment. Elevated CO₂ significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate (Anet ), intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi ) and carbon isotope composition ($\delta${\textonesuperior}{\textthreesuperior}C) and decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)) and total chlorophyll concentration based on mass (Chl(m)) and area (Chl(a)). On the other hand, elevated CO₂ decreased specific leaf area (SLA), which was increased by elevated temperature. Elevated CO₂ also increased foliar carbon concentration based on mass (C(m)) and area (C(a)), nitrogen concentration based on area (N(a)), carbohydrates concentration (i.e. sucrose, sugar, starch and non-structural carbohydrates) and the slope of the A(net)-N(a) relationship. However, elevated temperature decreased C(m), C(a) and N(a). The combination of elevated CO₂ and temperature hardly affected SLA, C(m), C(a), N(m), N(a), Chl(m) and Chl(a). Variables Anet and Na had positive linear relationships in all treatments. Our results showed that photosynthetic acclimation did not occur in dwarf bamboo at elevated CO₂ and it could adjust physiology and morphology to enable the capture of more light, to increase WUE and improve nutritional conditions.},

abstract = {1. During the first three weeks of growth with plentiful water and mineral nutrients 27 Mediterranean species of annuals showed a linear negative correlation of relative growth rate (RGR) with log initial seedling weight. The lower RGR values resulted mainly from lower specific leaf area (SLA) and occurred despite higher values for unit leaf rate (ULR); they were associated with larger amounts of DNA per cell and probably with larger cell size. 2. The RGR values for a given seed size fell in the sequence Asteraceae > Poaceae > Fabaceae. The Asteraceae had the highest leaf weight ratios, the Poaceae the highest SLA values, and the Poaceae and Fabaceae the highest ULR values. 3. The result of competition between larger- and smaller-seeded species is likely to depend on the distance apart at germination. 4. The species with the largest seeds tend to occupy the soils with a richer nutrient supply and greater water-holding capacity, and thus the species which tolerate the drier, more nutrient-poor sites have smaller seeds and higher potential RGR values.},

Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps).

This diminishing returns in SLA may result from changes in the relative numbers of different shoot types bearing leaves with different SLAs as trees increase in overall size. This ontogenetic shift hypothesis was examined for 15 Acer rubrum trees differing in basal stem diameter (0.01 m $\le$ D $\le$ 0.62 m). Detailed analyses of the largest tree showed that short-shoots produced leaves with significantly smaller SLA than the leaves produced by long-shoots regardless of the location of shoots within the canopy. A combination of random effect and split-plot (main-effect) ANOVA models showed that >94% of the variance observed for SLA was attributable to shoot type rather than to the location of leaves in the canopy. Further, with increasing trunk diameter, the number of short-shoots increased rapidly relative to the number of long-shoots. Although the leaves of short-shoots gain disproportionately more surface area per unit mass investment compared to the leaves produced by long-shoots, our data show that ontogenetic shifts occurring at the shoot and whole plant level account for size-dependent decreases in total canopy SLA.},

In the monospecific plantations, leaf longevity averaged 5, 6, 36, 46 and 66 months for Quercus rubra L., Larix decidua Miller, Pinus strobus L., Pinus resinosa Ait. and Picea abies (L.) Karst., respectively. Specific leaf area, maximum net photosynthesis per unit mass (A/mass), leaf N per unit mass (Nleaf/mass) and maximum net photosynthesis on a leaf N basis (A/Nleaf) were inversely correlated to leaf longevity (r2 = 0.92-0.97, 0.91, 0.88 and 0.80, respectively). Maximum net photosynthesis per unit area (A/area) was not correlated to leaf longevity, whereas leaf N per unit area (Nleaf/area) was positively correlated to leaf longevity (r2 = 0.95). For a similar-diameter conifer, species with long-lived foliage supported a greater foliage mass than species with short-lived foliage; however, Quercus rubra did not follow this pattern. At the stand level, total foliage mass ranged from 3.3 to 30.5 Mg ha-1 and was positively correlated (r2 = 0.97) to leaf longevity. Leaf area index (LAI) was also positively correlated (r2 = 0.82) to leaf longevity. Production efficiency (ANPP/LAI) was inversely related to leaf longevity and positively related to A/mass. Aboveground biomass and net primary production differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the five species but were not correlated to leaf longevity, total foliage mass or leaf area. In monospecific plantations, stem NPP for Larix decidua was 17% greater than for Pinus strobus and 14% less than for Picea abies, but in mixed-species plantations stem NPP for Larix decidua was 62 and 85% greater than for Pinus strobus and Picea abies, respectively. Similar aboveground net primary production rates can be attained by tree species with different leaf longevities because of trade-offs resulting from different structural and physiological leaf and canopy characteristics that are correlated to each other and to leaf longevity.},

Fast growing species and species that potentially can grow old showed a convex survivorship curve, whereas slower growing species and species that do not grow very old showed sigmoid, linear and convex survivorship curves. The species were grouped according to their DBH-height relationship and according to their maximum age, maximum growth rate, and maximum DBH. The groups probably reflect different light requirements. A negative correlation was found between maximum age and mortality rate. Growth rates vary within species, thus the largest tree is not necessarily the oldest.},

In seedling growth analyses, invasive woody species were compared with less-invasive woody species commonly cultivated in California using phylogenetically corrected procedures (12 phylogenetically independent contrasts). Invasive species were hypothesized to have higher seedling relative growth rates (RGRs) and specific leaf areas (SLAs) than did related less-invasive species. In phylogenetically independent contrasts conducted among taxa within families, high seedling RGRs and SLAs have significant positive associations with woody plant invasiveness. For contrasts containing species invasive in mediterranean regions, invasive species had significantly larger root biomass allocation than did less-invasive species. Optimization of fast seedling growth (high RGR) associated with opportunistic resource acquisition (high SLA) and increased root allocation to survive summer drought may be critical for the success of plant invaders in regions with mediterranean climates.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that photosynthesis and growth of tropical vegetation at its most northern distribution in Asia (Xishuangbanna, SW China) is adversely affected by seasonal drought and chilling temperatures. To test this hypothesis, we measured photosynthetic and growth characteristics of Zizyphus attopensis Pierre seedlings grown in three contrasting forest microhabitats: the understory, a small gap and a large gap. Photosynthetic capacity (light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), maximum rate of carboxylation and electron transport rate) and partitioning of leaf nitrogen (N) into carboxylation and electron transport differed significantly among seasons and microhabitats. Specific leaf area (SLA) did not change seasonally, but differed significantly among microhabitats and showed a negative linear relationship with daily integrated photon flux (PPF(i)). In contrast, leaf N concentration per unit area (N(a)) changed seasonally but did not differ among microhabitats. Measurements of maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) indicated that chronic photoinhibition did not occur in seedlings in any of the microhabitats during the study. Photosynthetic capacity was greatest in the wet season and lowest in the cool season. During the cool and dry seasons, the reduction in A(max) was greater in seedlings grown in the large gap than in in the understory and the small gap. Close logarithmic relationships were detected between PPF(i), leaf N(a) and photosynthetic capacity. Stem mass ratio decreased, and root mass ratio increased, in the dry season. We conclude that seasonal acclimation in growth and photosynthesis of the seedlings was associated with changes in biochemical features (particularly N(a) and partitioning of total leaf N between the different photosynthetic pools) and biomass allocation, rather than with changes in leaf morphological features (such as SLA). Local irradiance is the main factor driving seasonal variations in growth and photosynthesis in the study area, where the presence of heavy fog during the cool and dry seasons limits irradiance, but supplies water to the soil surface layers.},

abstract = {Fine roots play an important role in nutrient and water absorption and hence overall tree performance. However, current understanding of the ecological role of belowground traits lags considerably behind those of aboveground traits. In this study, we used data on specific root length (SRL), fine root diameter (D) and branching intensity (BI) of two datasets to examine interspecific trait coordination as well as intraspecific trait variation across ontogenetic stage and soil conditions (i.e., plasticity). The first dataset included saplings of 12 North American temperate tree species grown in monocultures in a common garden experiment to examine interspecific trait coordination. The second dataset included adult and juvenile individuals of four species (present in both datasets) co-occurring in natural forests on contrasting soils (i.e., humid organic, mesic, and xeric podzolic).The three fine root traits investigated were strongly coordinated, with high SRL being related to low D and high BI. Fine root traits and aboveground life-strategies (i.e., relative growth rate) were weakly coordinated and never significant. Intraspecific responses to changes in ontogenetic stage or soil conditions were trait dependent. SRL was significantly higher in juveniles compared to adults for Abies balsamea and Acer rubrum, but did not vary with soil condition. BI did not vary significantly with either ontogeny or soil conditions, while D was generally significantly lower in juveniles and higher in humid organic soils. D also had the least total variability most of which was due to changes in the environment (plasticity). This study brings support for the emerging evidence for interspecific root trait coordination in trees. It also indicates that intraspecific responses to both ontogeny and soil conditions are trait dependent and less concerted. D appears to be a better indicator of environmental change than SRL and BI.},

abstract = {Both atmospheric [CO2] and average surface temperatures are predicted to increase with potentially different, additive or opposing, effects on leaf quality and insect herbivore activity. Few studies have directly measured the interactive effects of concurrent changes in [CO2] and temperature on insect herbivores. None have done so over the entire developmental period of a tree-feeding insect, and none have compared responses to low pre-industrial [CO2] and present day [CO2] to estimate responses to future increases. Eucalypt herbivores may be particularly sensitive to climate-driven shifts in plant chemistry, as eucalypt foliage is naturally low in [N]. In this study, we assessed the development of the eucalypt herbivore Doratifera quadriguttata exposed concurrently to variable [CO2] (290, 400, 650 $\mu$mol mol(-1)) and temperature (ambient, ambient +4 {\textdegree}C) on glasshouse-grown Eucalyptus tereticornis. Overall, insects performed best on foliage grown at pre-industrial [CO2], indicating that modern insect herbivores have already experienced nutritional shifts since industrialisation. Rising [CO2] increased specific leaf mass and leaf carbohydrate concentration, subsequently reducing leaf [N]. Lower leaf [N] induced compensatory feeding and impeded insect performance, particularly by prolonging larval development. Importantly, elevated temperature dampened the negative effects of rising [CO2] on larval performance. Therefore, rising [CO2] over the past 200 years may have reduced forage quality for eucalypt insects, but concurrent temperature increases may have partially compensated for this, and may continue to do so in the future. These results highlight the importance of assessing plant-insect interactions within the context of multiple climate-change factors because of the interactive and potentially opposing effects of different factors within and between trophic levels.},

abstract = {Although competition between plants is nearly universal in vegetation, we know relatively little about belowground competition and how it interacts with aboveground competition in tropical forests, and almost nothing about such interactions on soils of intermediate fertility in sites with a moderate dry season, despite the fact that such forests are extensive. We investigated this over one year in a Panamanian tropical semi-evergreen rain forest, using tree seedlings (Simarouba amara, Gustavia superba, Tachigali versicolor, and Aspidosperma cruenta; least to most shade tolerant), experimental gaps, and trenching. Gaps increased growth and decreased mortality; growth increases were: Simarouba 684% (increase in height relative growth rate), Gustavia 411%, Aspidosperma 364%, and Tachigali 324%. Trenching in gaps increased growth in three species (Simarouba 49%, Gustavia 63%, and Aspidosperma 38%) but had very small effects in the understory; trenching did not affect mortality. We infer that trenching caused increased growth due to increased nutrients in the wet season, and increased water and/or nutrients in the dry season. Thus, across the tropics, in all but the wettest sites with fertile soils, seedlings of many species will be limited by belowground competition, at least in gaps. This is similar to the pervasive importance of belowground competition in temperate forests. Read More: http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/04-0677},

We evaluate how architectural traits related to Hmax vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and Hmax varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to Hmax at larger reference diameters (14{\textendash}80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult unde...},

Seedlings were grown in pots in a greenhouse in 45, 30, 10.6, 4.8 and 1.8% of full sunlight. Shading for 60 days had no effect on survival, but it influenced all growth parameters measured. Total biomass decreased with decreasing irradiance, reflecting reductions in dry mass of leaves, stems and roots. In response to shading, allocation of biomass to leaves increased, while allocation of biomass to roots decreased. Specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio increased with decreasing irradiance. Decreases in relative growth rate were caused by reductions in net assimilation rate rather than leaf area ratio. Photosynthetic efficiency, as determined by the Fv/Fm ratio (Fv = variable fluorescence, Fm = maximal fluorescence), was unaffected by the shading treatments. Partial removal of leaves, stem or roots did not affect seedling survival. Seedlings responded to removal of plant parts by compensatory growth. Topophysis was observed when the apex was removed: the lateral buds developed only as new plagiotropic lateral shoots; consequently, the decapitated plant ceased height growth and was unable to compete with its neighbors for light.},

abstract = {1. Numerous plant traits are known to influence aspects of individual performance, including rates of carbon uptake, tissue turnover, mortality and fecundity. These traits are bound to influence emergent properties of vegetation because quantities such as leaf-area cover, average height, primary productivity and density of standing biomass result from the collective behaviour of individuals. Yet, little is known about the influence of individual traits on these emergent properties, despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is defined by a constellation of traits. 2. We examine the influence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf-area index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait-, size- and patch-structured model ({TSPM)} of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual-level growth processes and probabilistic disturbances to landscape-level predictions. A physiological growth model incorporating relevant trade-offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegetation dynamics. 3. We modelled single-species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not seed-limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on biomass density. Leaf economic strategy influenced minimum light requirement, and thus total leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation influenced vegetation mainly by modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes amplified, across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval. 4. Synthesis: Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegetation, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next-generation vegetation models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure of vegetation.},

abstract = {I investigated the relationship between leaf physiological traits and decomposition of leaf litter for 35 plant species of contrasting growth forms from a lowland tropical forest in Panama to determine whether leaf traits could be used to predict decomposition. Decomposition rate (k) was correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) across all species. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass) was not correlated with k, but structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model with significant indirect effects of Amass on k through SLA, N, and P, but not K. The results indicate that the decomposability of leaf tissue in this tropical forest is related to a global spectrum of leaf economics that varies from thin, easily decomposable leaves with high nutrient concentrations and high photosynthetic rates to thick, relatively recalcitrant leaves with greater physical toughness and defenses and low photosynthetic rates. If this pattern is robust across biomes, then selection for suites of traits that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain over the lifetime of the leaf may be used to predict the effects of plant species on leaf litter decomposition, thus placing the ecosystem process of decomposition in an evolutionary context.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF STUDY: New Caledonia commonly experiences cyclones, so trees there are expected to have enhanced wood traits and trunk allometry that confer resistance to wind damage. We ask whether there is evidence of a trade-off between these traits and growth rate among species. METHODS: Wood traits, including density, microfibril angle (MFA), and modulus of elasticity (MOE), ratio of tree height to stem diameter, and growth rate were investigated in mature trees of 15 co-occurring canopy species in a New Caledonian rainforest. KEY RESULTS: In contrast to some studies, wood density did not correlate negatively with growth increment. Among angiosperms, wood density and MOE correlated positively with diameter-adjusted tree height, and MOE correlated positively with stem-diameter growth increment. Tall slender trees achieved high stiffness with high efficiency with respect to wood density, in part by low MFA, and with a higher diameter growth increment but a lower buckling safety factor. However, some tree species of a similar niche differed in whole-tree resistance to wind damage and achieved wood stiffness in different ways. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a growth-safety trade-off in these trees. In forests that regularly experience cyclones, there may be stronger selection for high wood density and/or stiffness in fast-growing trees of the upper canopy, with the potential growth trade-off amortized by access to the upper canopy and by other plant traits. Furthermore, decreasing wood density does not necessarily decrease resistance to wind damage, resistance being influenced by other characteristics including cell-level traits (e.g., MFA) and whole-plant architecture.},
