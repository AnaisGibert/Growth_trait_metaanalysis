\begin{enumerate}

\item
Growth rates (GR) have often been seen as central elements of plant ecological strategies, and as linked to species traits. Yet, the literature is inconsistent about empirical correlations between functional traits and plant growth rate, casting doubt on the capacity of traits to predict growth.

\item
Traits should influence growth in a way that depend on individual plants size. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theory, and test these predictions in tree species for five traits using a meta-analysis of 112 studies (> 500 correlations). As a first approximation of plants size, we analysed the shift in the correlations between growth and traits across three plant stages (i.e. juvenile, sapling and adult).

\item
Results were consistent with predictions. Specific leaf area was correlated with GR in juvenile but not in adult plants. Correlations of GR with wood density and assimilation rate were not affected by stage. Maximum height and seed mass were correlated with GR only in one plant stage category.

\item
Synthesis: We show that traits-GR correlations change in a predictable way as a function of plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from attributing slow vs fast growth to species throughout life, in favour of attributing growth trajectories.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The phrase ``plant ecological strategy'' refers to how species face common challenges of acquiring sufficient water, nutrients and light for growth, and then ultimately to replace themselves with offspring. An idea that species strategy differences might involve fast versus slow growth goes back at least to \citet{Grime:1975gr}, who measured a wide spread of relative growth rates for seedlings during early exponential growth under favourable conditions. Seedling potential relative growth rate (RGR) has continued to be used as a major strategy indicator within the CSR (Competitor - Stress tolerator - Ruderal) classification (e.g. \citealt{grime1979plant, Grime:1997wm}). Meanwhile partitioning of seedling RGR into different components showed that specific leaf area (SLA = 1/leaf mass per area LMA) was typically the strongest source of variation between species \citep{Poorter:1989tx}. From the 1990s a new style of ``trait ecology'' arose whereby measurable traits including SLA were used directly as strategy axes \citep{Westoby:2002ft}. An approach via measurable traits made broad comparisons possible across continents and latitudes and thousands of species. Since then, traits have been seen as constructive approaches to understanding plant growth strategies \citep{Grime:1977kc,Chapin:1980gz}, community composition \citep{Lavorel:2002ff,Shipley:2006ie}, global vegetation dynamics \citep{Scheiter:2013ed} and ecosystem processes \citep{Lavorel:2002ff}.

Currently, two main spectra of variation are widely cited as underpinning differences between species in vegetative growth rates. The ``leaf economic spectrum'' \citep{Wright:2004jb} and the ``wood economic spectrum'' \citep{Chave:2009iy} reflect tissue construction costs (for leaf area and for wood volume respectively), trading off with rates of tissue turnover or mortality. It has been widely expected that species with low tissue construction cost will typically have fast growth rates, at least in favourable physical environments \citep[e.g.][]{MullerLandau:2004dc,Wright:2004jb,Poorter:2008iu,Chave:2009iy,Larjavaara:2010bn,Iida:2012jb,Paine:2015df}. Yet, a growing number of empirical studies indicate the correlation between traits and growth is not as consistent as that. Consider SLA as an illustration. Species with high SLA can deploy more canopy area for a given dry mass investment in leaves \citep{Poorter:1999wd, Reich:1992wm}. In addition, SLA is correlated with high photosynthetic rates and high nitrogen (N) or phosphorus concentrations in the leaf \citep{Wright:2004jb}. For seedling relative growth rates under favourable conditions, high SLA has repeatedly been found to be a strong predictor regardless of vegetation type or growth form \citep{Lambers:1992bj,Reich:1992wm,Grime:1997wm,Poorter:1999wd,Wright:1999ds}. Yet for adult plants, this correlation appears weaker or absent \citep{coomes_comparison_1998,Poorter:2008iu,Aiba:2009ft,Easdale:2009gv,Wright:2010tp}. The growing discrepancy between theoretical expectation and empirical results has led some to question whether traits are even useful for understanding growth \citep{Wright:2010tp, Paine:2015df}.

Meanwhile the possibility has been raised that trait-growth correlations may change systematically with size \citep{Enquist:2007ek,Falster:2011ii, Ruger:2012jv, Iida:2014ep, Iida:2014hq}. Recent theory suggests that the absence of a correlation between SLA and growth at larger sizes may be expected, when potential influences of traits on plant function are considered \citep{Falster:2011ii, falster:2013}. At larger sizes the low-cost deployment benefits of high SLA may be offset or even outweighted by the high costs of rapid leaf turnover (see section ``Theoretical expectations''). While recent empirical studies supported the idea of a variation in the relationships between traits and growth rates across plant sizes (\citealt{Iida:2014ep, Iida:2014hq}), the trend and mechanisms behind this variation remain unclear. It is still an opening question whether the influence of traits on growth change with plant size in a predictable and consistent way.

In this paper, we used a meta-analytic approach on five prominent traits (specific leaf area = SLA, wood or stem tissue density = WD, maximum leaf photosynthetic capacity per unit area = Aarea, maximum height= Hmax, and seed mass= SM) to investigate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How general is the tendency for correlations between traits and growth rate to vary with plant size?
  \item  Do the observed relationships conform to predictions (outlined in section ``Theoretical expectations'') from a recently developed mechanistic model (Falster et al., 2011; Falster, 2013)?
\end{enumerate}
We gathered correlation coefficients between trait and growth from studies that gave explicit information about the size or stage of the plants. While most studies on traits have not been concerned with effects of plant size, they have generally reported trait-growth correlations for identifiable stage classes. We used plant stage (i.e. juvenile, sapling and adult) as a first approximation of plant size. We focused mainly on tree and woody species since the mechanistic model used to assess our predictions is most applicable to tree.

\section*{Theoretical expectations}\label{theory}

Recent theoretical work \citep{Falster:2011ii} allows us to formulate hypotheses about relationships between traits and growth, based on a mathematical decomposition of plant growth rate. Specific predictions arise from considering the influence of traits on elements of these equations and how these effects may vary with size (see Appendix\ref{sec:growth} for mathematical explanations).

\textbf{H1: The relationship between specific leaf area (SLA) and growth rate is expected to shift from positive in seedlings to non-significant or negative in adult plants}

Plants with high SLA can deploy more leaf area per unit of mass invested. However, high-SLA species also have shorter leaf lifespan and faster leaf turnover rate \citep{Wright:2004jb}. Whether plant growth increases with SLA depends on the relative magnitude of the leaf construction and leaf turnover effects of SLA (Table 1). During early life, while leaf comprises a large part of the plant, decreasing leaf construction cost has a positive effect on growth rate. As plants increase in size and leaf mass fraction decreases, the benefit of cheaper leaf construction diminishes; thus the cost of replacing leaf turnover becomes more important.

\textbf{H2: The relationship between wood or stem density (WD) and growth rate is expected to be negative across all plant size}

Low WD decreases the cost of building stem tissue and thus the cost of deploying additional leaf area (Table 1), which should result in faster growth. Although cheaper wood carries a risk of increased mortality, this cost is not reflected in growth outcomes. Thus decreasing WD is predicted to increase growth across the entire size range.

\textbf{H3: The relationship between asymptotic maximum height (Hmax) and growth rate is expected to be absent in seedlings but to strengthen with increasing plant size.}

As plants approach maximum height they increasingly divert energy away from growth and into reproduction (see \citealt{Thomas:1996do, Falster:2011ii, Wenk:2014jz}). For seedlings, where all individuals are investing solely in growth, we expect no influence of Hmax on growth. As plants become larger, species with smaller Hmax are expected to be allocating more to reproduction and less to growth, because at any given size they are closer to their Hmax (Table 1).

\textbf{H4: The relationship between seed mass (SM) and relative growth rate is negative in seedlings, but weakens with increasing size.}

The main effect of increased seed size is to produce a larger overall seedling. Generally relative growth rate decreases with size, and as such larger seedlings are predicted to have a lower relative growth rate during the earliest phases of growth \citet{Turnbull:2012ew}. However, among larger plants we expect the effect of this initial size to be minimal, and thus the correlation between seed size and growth rate should disappear.

\textbf{H5: The relationship between maximum photosynthetic rate (Aarea) and growth rate is expected to be positive across all plant sizes, at least under high-light conditions}

We expect greater photosynthetic capacity to translate into faster growth rates by increasing the rate of biomass production (Table 1), at least at high light where Aarea is measured. It is uncertain how much this might translate to faster growth in low light.

\textbf{Effect on absolute (AbsGR) and relative growth rate (RGR)}
Tree growth in diameter, height or mass can be expressed in either absolute (AbsGR) or relative terms (RGR). According to the growth model, the predicted relationship between growth and either SLA or seed mass in seedlings revert if absolute $Abs_{mass}$ is used instead of $RGR_{mass}$ (see Appendix 1\ref{sec:growth}). For SLA, the correlation with $RGR_{mass}$ is positive but becomes negative with $AbsGR_{mass}$. For SM the correlation with $RGR_{mass}$ is negative but becomes positive with $AbsGR_{mass}$. For the others traits (WD, Hmax and Aarea), the predicted relationships are not affected by the growth measurement used.


\section*{Materials and methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\subsection*{Literature snapshot}\label{literature-snapshot}
We aimed to identify studies that measured the correlation between five prominent functional trait (SLA, WD, Aarea, Hmax and Seed mass) and a growth measurement across species. According to a snapshot of the literature on Web of Science database (Thomson Reuters), 82\% of the literature for these 5 traits is captured by searching only on SLA and WD. This snapshot was performed between March and June 2014 using a range of Boolean search terms in English. Search terms were as follows: (``TRAIT'' AND (``growth rate'' OR ``relative growth rate'')) AND (``tree*'' OR ``woody*''), ``TRAIT'' was all trait names listed in Table A1. While Web of Science guarantees a relatively stable and reproducible search environment, with clearly defined lists of indexed journals, its searches are restricted to metadata, such as title, keywords and abstracts \citep{Beckmann:2012hn}. This limitation does not apply to Google Scholar, where, theoretically, all text that is electronically available on the Internet will be indexed. Thus, we used Google Scholar to perform a more systematic search of the literature for SLA and WD.

\subsection*{Systematic search}\label{systematic-search}
Google Scholar database was searched using the range of Boolean search terms for SLA and WD. Search terms were as follows: ((``SLA'' OR ``LMA'' OR ``specific leaf area'' OR ``leaf mass area'' OR ``wood density'' OR ``WD'' OR ``wood specific gravity'' OR ``stem density'' OR ``stem specific density'') AND (``growth rate'' OR ``relative growth rate'')) AND (tree* OR woody*). The keyword search in Google Scholar returns approx. 18900 papers. For comparison, with the same keyword search Web of Science returns 541 papers. Thus, in Google Scholar we displayed papers by relevance and examined the first 750 items. We also identified and recorded other possible data sources using our own knowledge as researchers in the field (this included adding data from an as-yet unpublished study by Gleason et al). To avoid publication bias due to selective reporting of significant results within published articles (e.g.~particular case of a ``failure to publish bias'' see \citealt{Jennions:2013ta}), we asked the authors for additional information when they reported a non-significant correlation between growth and trait without reporting a correlation coefficient value. The complete list of studies where we inspected the full text is given in Appendix \ref{app:supp_info_files} in Supplementary material.

Each study had to meet some basic criteria to be included in our analysis. We restricted our meta-analysis to documents reporting: i) the relationship between growth and trait as a correlation coefficient, ii) the sample size and the number of species used to perform the correlation, and iii) the size/stage of plants. Ultimately data was included from 112 different articles (starred references in bibliography).

Where available we also recorded the geographic coordinates, number of sites, experiment type (greenhouse, field experiment, forest, shade-house etc.), growth measure (relative or absolute growth rate measured using plant diameter, height or mass), vegetation type, life form (tree, woody or mixed with herbaceous species etc.), biological scale (interspecific, intraspecific or intragenus), and experimental treatments (e.g. fertilization, shade, salt stress). We reported coefficient correlations for a list of 20 traits (Fig. \ref{Fig1}): the five for which we had prior expectations, plus 15 others which capture different aspects of plant species strategies and are commonly addressed in the trait literature. Specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, net (mass) assimilation rates (NAR), and assimilation rate of CO2 (Aarea) are traits involved in species leaf economic strategy \citep{Wright:2004jb,Wright:2010tp}. Seed mass (SM), and maximum plant height (Hmax) capture information about reproductive strategy \citep{Falster:2005bw,Moles:2006ft}. Wood density (WD) and sapwood area per leaf area (SA/LA), vessel size and density, and stem specific conductance are all involved in species wood economic strategy  \citep{Chave:2009iy}. Here WD and SA/LA are also considered as indicators of stem construction cost (\citep{Falster:2011ii}, whereas SLA and leaf thickness capture crucial information about leaf construction cost \citep{Wright:2004jb}. Finally, the leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio are indicators of resource allocation to leaf \citep{Lambers:1992bj}. According to the snapshot of the literature on Web of Science, 62\% of the literature for these 20 traits were captured by a search on SLA and WD.


\subsection*{Plant stage categories}\label{plant-stage-categories}

The authors of the 112 articles reported in our meta-analyses, categorized plants into four differents stages (i.e. seedling, juvenile, sapling, adult). While the stage categories have been established according to the expertise and the appreciation of the authors, by compiling data across multiple studies and across different growth form (tree and woody, etc), there is a risk of assigning plants of similar size to different categories. We verified the consistency of size/age range attributed to each stage across the 112 studies reported here. Fig. \ref{Fig2} showed that the thresholds in size/age used by the authors to defined a plant stage are quite steady. In particular, there was a clear break between seedlings and saplings in both age (at 1 yr) and height (at 0.5 m); there was also a clear break between saplings and adults in diameter (at 10 cm). According to simple allometric relationships from the Biomass And Allometry Database (BAAD) \citep{Falster:2015}, these stage cutoffs match across the different size measurements (i.e. diameter, height and age, Fig. \ref{FigA1}). The size/stage threshold defined across the 112 articles, allowed us to attribute straightforwardly a stage category to studies for which no stage have been distinctly mentionned by the authors (5\% of the data, noted as ``mix'' in Fig. \ref{Fig2}).

Less than 5\% of the studies (i.e. five studies on 112) were ambiguous on their plant stage attribution. Half of these equivocal cases involved the juvenile category. The term ``juvenile'' is vague enough to cover size range from either seedling or sapling stages. according to the authors. This redundancy encourages us to focus on a three stage classification (i.e. juvenile, sapling, adult) instead of a four stage one (i.e. seedling, juvenile, sapling, adult). In the rest of the mansucript we preferred the term ``juvenile'' to ``seedling'', because for a portion of the scientific community ``seedling'' also refers to a particular experimental condition (a greenhouse experiment). We attributed a study to a new stage category only when 95\% of the recorded range of sizes for that study lay within a new stage category. The others equivocal cases were caused by an ambiguity in the definition of ``adult'' used by the authors. Some plants with a large stature are not assessed as adult by the authors because they are still non reproductive (see ID 52 and 50). Here, we attributed a study to the adult stage when the authors identified the plants as reproductive, and to sapling stage when they identified the plants as non-reproductive, regardless the plant size or age. Results using the categories established by the authors are similar than the one using the standardized categories and are available in Fig. \ref{FigA5} model.1. In the main text, we report the results using the standardized categories.


\subsection*{Statistical analyses}\label{statistical-analyses}

Effect size calculation:
We used the cross-species Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient r between growth rate and species trait as our measure of effect size, weighted by the number of species contributing. When studies did not report r values but another coefficient such as coefficient of determination (R2), Spearman's rho rank correlation or Kendall's tau rank correlation, we converted these to correlation coefficients  \citep{Lajeunesse:2013tm} (see code in Appendix \ref{app:supp_info_files} for details). When the magnitude of Pearson's correlation coefficient approaches +/- 1, its distribution becomes skewed. Accordingly we transformed the correlation r into a metric with desirable statistical properties using Fisher's z-transformation,

\[ z = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1+r}{1-r} \]

which has a variance estimate

\[ v_z= \frac{1}{n-3} \]

n being the number of species. We weighted effect size by the study precision using the number of species instead of the sample size because the question addressed in our study concerned the correlation between growth and traits across species and not within species.

Stage effect:
We tested stage effect on traits for which > 15 correlation coefficients across at least two stages were recorded. We used a mixed-effect model of meta-analysis, in which it is assumed that studies within a stage share a common mean effect but that there is also random variation among studies in a stage, in addition to sampling variation. This random effect allows us to account for the heterogeneity among studies (e.g.~experimental type, vegetation type, error, etc.). For each trait, we established if stage could explain variance in the coefficient correlation by comparing models with the stage variable to the null model using log-likelihood ratios \citep{Zuur:2009cfa}. If the log-likelihood test returned a significant p-value, the stage model fitted the data better than the null model. Estimates of the effect size for each stage were considered significant if the 95\% confidence intervals did not overlap with zero.

Sensitivity analysis:
We tested how robust are our results to the decision made in the analysis. In particular we tested our prediction using two datatset with different inclusion criteria. The number of species used to perform the correlation, the experimental conditions, and the concordance between stage used to measure trait and growth are clear criteria for assessing the quality of the data for addressing our hypotheses. Therefore, we focused exclusively on correlation across species, and we stratified the data set into two subsets: one including only studies under unstressed conditions ('ideal' dataset), and the other set including studies under all conditions ('complete' dataset). We excluded from the ``ideal'' dataset studies where growth and traits were measured on plants from different stages, unless a particular stage is by definition required to measure a trait such as for seed mass (i.e. seed stage), or Hmax (i.e. adult stage).
We also tested the sentivity of our results to the dominance of one or a few studies that measured a large number of response for the same trait. In the case of multiple comparisons within a study, we used the method proposed by \citet{Borenstein:2009um}: we calculated the mean correlation coefficient by trait and by study, and re-calculated the effect size. This corresponds to the ”reduced dataset” where multiple responses were condensed into a single average within a trait and within a study.

Quality criteria for meta-analysis:
We conducted several analyses to assess the reliability of our meta-analysis. In particular, we quantified heterogeneity in effects size, we tested for publication bias and we explored temporal change in effect size (see Appendix \ref{app:supp_info_files}). We addressed the 14 methodological quality criteria listed by \citet{Koricheva:2014ku} as required to assess the relaibility of a meta-analyses (Table A2 detailed how and where in this article each citeria is addressed).

Availability of code and data:
All analyses were conducted with R software \citep{Ralanguageanden:2014wf}. The code and data underpinning this paper is available at github.com/AnaisGibert/Growth\_trait\_metaanalysis. Archival copies are also included in Appendix \ref{app:supp_info_files} in Supplementary material.

\section*{Results}\label{results}

\subsection*{Main effects}

For both SLA and SM, the correlation between growth rate and the trait changed significantly with plant size in the manner expected. Model fits improved when stage was incorporated (see log likelihood ratio tests, Fig. \ref{Fig3} a and d; average values for the coefficients r ($r_{\textrm{mean}}$) in Fig. \ref{FigA4}). The correlation between growth and SLA shifted from strongly positive at juvenile stage $r_{\textrm{mean}}=0.6 \pm 0.08$, Mean +SD) to not significantly different from zero at adult stage ($r_{\textrm{mean}}= -0.01 \pm 0.07$, CI 95\% overlapping zero in Fig. \ref{Fig3} a). The correlation between growth and SM shifted from negative at juvenile stage ($r_{\textrm{mean}}= -0.59 \pm 0.07$) to not significantly different from zero at adult stage ($r_{\textrm{mean}}= -0.09 \pm 0.02$, , CI 95\% overlapping zero in Fig. \ref{Fig3} d). For both traits, correlation coefficients recorded at sapling stage were intermediate between juvenile and adult stages.

For WD, Hmax and Aarea, correlations with growth were also reasonably consistent with expectations, though with limitations arising from very unequal numbers of observations between growth stages. For Hmax, the expectation was for a correlation with growth to be absent for small plants but present at intermediate and larger sizes, the mechanism being increased relative allocation to reproduction as Hmax is approached. Indeed Hmax was positively correlated with growth at adult stage ($r_{\textrm{mean}}= 0.38 \pm 0.05$, n=18). At sapling and juvenile stages, the correlation between Hmax and growth was not significantly different from that observed at adult stage (model fit not improved when stage was incorporated, see log likelihood ratio tests in Fig. \ref{Fig3} c), but also was consistent with no correlation (Fig \ref{Fig3} c, confidence intervals overlapping zero), due to much smaller numbers of replicate studies. Similarly for WD and for Aarea, results were consistent with negative (WD) and positive (Aarea) correlations with growth across all plant sizes (Fig. \ref{Fig3} b and e, model fit not improved when stage was incorporated). However, at the same time confidence intervals of r often spanned zero especially where there were small numbers of studies for particular growth stages.

RGR in mass and height are commonly used to measure growth in small size tree, whereas AbsGR in diameter or height are more often used for larger stature tree. A ECRIRE

\subsection*{Coverage of dataset}

Given our basic conclusion that reported correlations responded to plant size in a manner consistent with expectations from theory, we assess now the coverage of the available data, to determine if biased sampling could have erroneously generated the above results. The results reported were confined to correlations across species, and under non-stressed conditions (n=176). A ``complete'' dataset (n=216) also included correlations measured under stressed conditions, and spanning different plant stages between the growth and trait measurements. This ``complete'' dataset generated similar effect sizes to those reported above from the ``ideal'' dataset, and led to similar conclusions (Fig. \ref{Fig3} grey points). Differences concerned often the confidence intervals around particular mean effect sizes in Fig. \ref{Fig3}. These differences in CI were not easily attributed to any single cause. For instance, the correlation between growth and WD at juvenile stage shifted from negative to non significant (i.e CI95\% included zero) due to 2 positive correlation coefficients from \citet{Augspurger:1984ct};  these correlations unlike others used wood density values from adult plants together with growth from juveniles. For Aarea, the comparison between complete and ideal data showed no signal of an effect of stress (here mainly low light) on the correlation with growth at seedling stage; the correlation was still positive between Aarea and growth even when 7 correlations measured under low light conditions were added. Finally, our results were unlikely to be biased by dominance of one or a few studies that measured a large number of responses, since when multiple responses were condensed into a single average within a trait and within a study, outcomes were very similar (Fig. \ref{FigA5}).

We were pleasantly surprised to find that correlations had been reported for at least two different stages across 18 traits out of the 20 targeted (Fig. \ref{Fig1}). We had thought it likely that for some traits correlations would be reported only for one size class, or only mixed across different sizes. These limitations applied only for LAR and NARmass, where studies appeared confined to juvenile stages. However, among the 20 traits studied we had enough data to test the effect of stage on the correlation between growth and traits only for the five for which we had predictions.

We found 112 studies published between between 1983 and 2014 that met our requirements. Climate zones spanned from temperate regions to  tropics (map in Fig. \ref{FigA2}). Different experiment types (laboratory, field, plantation or greenhouse), growth measurements and growth form (tree, woody or across growth form) were included. Number of species used for each correlation ranged from 2 to 300 species with average 31. Given this variety, it was not surprising to find wide ranges of r reported for all traits. For instance, r varied from -0.98 to 0.99 for SLA, and from -0.74 to 0.74 for WD (Fig. \ref{FigA3}). The growth form, the experiment types and the growth measurement were not markedly best predictors of the data (results shown in the Fig. \ref{FigA5}).

We met all the quality criteria required for meta-analysis in ecology (Table 2). We showed that the impact of publication bias is probably trivial in our meta-analyses (Appendix D, Fig. \ref{FigA7}). The extend of the heterogenity was high in our meta-analysis, and substantially explained by the plant stage for SLA and Seedmass as expected (Appendix D). Finally, temporal change in effect size did not jeopardizing the stability of our conclusions for all the traits (Appendix D, Fig. \ref{FigA9}).


\section*{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The meta-analysis reported here demonstrates that the influence of traits on growth rates changes as plants grow from small to large, for several key traits. While this point has been made recently in smaller scale studies, it is the first time that mechanistic hypotheses are confirmed across a large number of studies already available. Meta-analysis allowed us to generalize and help to reach a concensus about trait influences on growth. Thus, plant growth rates change with size through ontogeny \citep{Condit:1993hd, Clark:1999ed, Herault:2011dd} - \textit{they follow a trajectory of growth} - and species traits should be understood as influencing this trajectory and consequently rearranging the ranking of growth rates with size, rather than as rendering species fast-growing or slow-growing throughout life.

\subsection*{Traits influence on growth along plant size}

Further, for five prominent traits, the patterns observed are consistent with specific predictions from a mechanistic growth model. This indicates provisionally that the mechanisms through which traits affect growth are correctly understood in the model. For specific leaf area (SLA) and for seed mass (SM) the meta-analysis confirms quite strongly the predicted influence of plant size on the trait-growth correlation. For wood density (WD), assimilation rate of CO2 (Aarea) and maximum height (Hmax) results were consistent with predictions, but coverage was limited and additional studies would be helpful for some trait-growth-stage relationships.

It has previously been noted that the correlation of SLA with growth disappears among saplings and larger trees (\citealt{Wright:2010tp} for Barro Colorado Island forest, Panama), and this meta-analysis generalises that result. Several authors have suggested that the disappearance of SLA's influence on growth might be due to a disproportionate accumulation of leaf area by low SLA species \citep{Reich:1992wm,Poorter:2008iu,Wright:2010tp}, yet it remain uncear whether such a mechanism works as intended. More importantly, the assumed empirical relationship between SLA and total leaf area does not hold true across large number of species (Duursma and Falster, in review).In the model described here, the mechanism is slightly different: high-SLA species incur faster leaf and other tissues turnovers, the cost of which outweighs the benefits of cheap leaf construction at larger sizes.

For seedlings our meta-analyses showed as expected a negative relationship between seed mass and relative growth rate (in mass or height or volume) that disappeared across plant stage. This negative relationship arises because seedlings from larger seeds are larger to begin with, as extensively discussed in the literature \citep[reviewed by][]{Turnbull:2012ew}. It applies only to RGR not to absolute growth rate, but for seedlings growth is most often reported as RGR (Appendix Fig. \ref{FigA8} d).

For WD the meta-analysis showed negative correlation with growth across all plant stages, as previously reported from individual studies \citep{Wright:2010tp,Ruger:2012jv}. It should be noted however that there are few tests of this proposition at seedling stage. In our model (Text Box 1 \ref{sec:growth}) cheaper stem construction is responsible for the predicted negative correlation. Lower xylem conductance and associated lower photosynthetic potential have also been suggested \citep[reviewed by][]{Chave:2009iy}.

For the correlation between Aarea and growth, to our knowledge no study has previously assessed this in relation to plant size. In the growth model (Text Box 1 \ref{sec:growth}), a consistent correlation irrespective of size arises from a direct effect of Aarea on plant growth rate. In juvenile stage, where most of the data were, we noted no signal of an effect of low light on the positive correlation between Aarea and growth rate.

Meta-analysis showed a positive correlation between Hmax and growth for adult stage, but not for saplings and juveniles. The trend for tall stature species to grow faster at a given tree size than small stature species has been noted across several tree size classes and forest types (e.g. \citealt{Poorter:2008iu,Wright:2010tp,Herault:2011dd,Ruger:2012jv,Iida:2014ep}). In \citet{Wright:2010tp}, Hmax was considered as the weakest predictor of growth rates of saplings; however it was the strongest predictor of growth rates of large trees. \citet{Poorter:2008iu} speculated that the Hmax-RGR relationship among large trees might arise from including small tree species with maximum size not much larger than the  10cm dbh lower threshold used to define large trees. In our growth equations, Hmax affects growth via the fraction of energy diverted to reproduction. At a given tree size, species closer to their Hmax are expected to be allocating relatively less to vegetative growth. However this applies only at sizes where some of the species have begun to reproduce, and should not affect sapling and juvenile growth rates.

\subsection*{No signal of cross-correlations among different traits}

It is notable that the expected correlations between traits and growth do not appear to be much overridden by cross-correlations among different traits. A recurring issue in trait ecology is how many of the observed correlations arise directly from mechanisms, versus how many from secondary cross-correlation. For example, several papers have suggested that correlations between Hmax and growth rate may arise via cross-correlation with other traits such as WD \citep{Thomas:1996do, Poorter:2006vb, Wright:2010tp}. Similarly, effects of SM on growth have been suspected to be mediated via other traits \citep{Shipley:1990js,Westoby:2002ft,Poorter:2006vb}. Secondary cross-correlation might also potentially have the effect of suppressing a correlation that would otherwise be present. While such effects may still be observed within individual studies, across the range of studies reported we found that the available data were consistent with predictions arising directly from mechanisms.

\subsection*{Future research directions}

Light and water micro-environments can affect growth values, and might modify correlations with traits in relation to plant size. For example, instead of a positive relationship that disappeared with plant size, \citet{Iida:2014ep} found SLA was negatively correlated with RGR at small size and positively correlated with RGR at larger sizes. Similarly, instead of a negative correlation between WD and growth across all plant stages, \citep{Iida:2014ep,Iida:2014hq} found a negative correlation at small size that disappeared when trees were larger. \citet{Iida:2014hq} explained the switch in directionality by changes in light and water condition up the vertical profile within a forest: larger trees reached a position in the canopy where they were released from light limitations, other resources such as water may have become limiting, and the performance of trees may then have been regulated by different traits. Note that in \citet{Iida:2014hq}, the shift in the correlation between growth and WD occurred for trees larger than 22-26 cm dbh. This points to one of the possible limitations in our meta-analysis, where trees with height above 5 m were pooled as ``adult''.

Clearly there is much scope for strengthening our understanding of correlations between traits and growth through (1) adding further empirical studies for traits and size-classes with weaker representation, (2) accounting more satisfactorily for variables such as light, and (3) expressing plant sizes on continuous scales of mass or height rather than through the approximate and partly subjective categories unavoidably adopted here. Additional data are specifically required in small plants (juvenile and sapling) for WD and Hmax, and in large plants (adult and sapling) for Aarea and more broadly for all traits requiring a measure of whole plant biomass (e.g. LMR, LAR, NAR). Nevertheless the existing published evidence, even with all its limitations, is consistent with predictions from a simple growth model, and this suggests that species traits can shed light on their growth trajectories, and hence on the changing growth rate rankings across species as individuals become larger.

\subsection*{Derivation of hypotheses from growth equations}

We adapted growth equations from \cite{Falster:2011ii} and \cite{falster:2013} to generate hypotheses on both absolute and relative growth rates in mass (eqn \ref{eq:eq1}), height (eqn \ref{eq:eq2}) and diameter (eqn \ref{eq:eq4}).

The rate at which \textbf{live biomass} $b$ is produced by a plant is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq0}
\underbrace{\color{green}\frac{db}{dt}}_{\text{net live biomass production}} = \underbrace{y}_{\text{yield}}  \big(\underbrace{a_{l} A_{\textrm{area}}}_{\text{photosynthesis}} - \underbrace{\sum_{i=l,s,r,f} m_{i} r_{i}}_{\text{respiration}}\big) - \underbrace{ \sum_{i=l,s,r,f} m_{i} k_{i}}_{\text{turnover}},
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the ratio of carbon fixed in mass per carbon assimilated,  and  $A_{\textrm{area}}$ is the assimilation rate of CO$_{2}$ per leaf area.

Here, and in the following equations, $m_i$ denotes the \textbf{live mass on the plant}, $r_i$ the mass-specific \textbf{respiration rate}, and $k_i$ the \textbf{turnover rate} of different plant tissues; the subscripts $i=l,s,r,t,f$ referring to leaves, sapwood and bark, roots, total of these vegetative tissues, and to the reproductive tissues (fruits, flowers etc.) (note that the live biomass $b= m_t +m_f$). Similarly $a_i$ denotes \textbf{areas}, of leaves ($i=l$) and of cross-sections of total stem and sapwood ($i= st,ss$) respectively.


The \textbf{growth rate in mass}, being the increment in vegetative live mass ($m_t$), is then:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq1}
\underbrace{{\color{magenta}\frac{dm_t}{dt}}}_{\text{growth rate in mass}} = \underbrace{\color{blue}\frac{dm_t}{db}}_{\text{allocation to vegetative growth}}  \times \underbrace{\color{green}\frac{db}{dt}}_{\text{net live biomass production}},
\end{equation}

where allocation to growth is the fraction of net live biomass increase that goes to vegetative growth rather than to reproductive tissue production.

The \textbf{growth rate in height} can then be expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq2}
\underbrace{\frac{dH}{dt}}_{\text{growth rate in height}} = \underbrace{\frac{dH}{da_{l}}}_{\text{architecture layout}} \times \underbrace{{\color{orange}\frac{da_{l}}{dm_{t}}}}_{\text{leaf deployment per mass}} \times {\color{blue}\frac{dm_t}{db}} \times {\color{green}\frac{db}{dt}}.
\end{equation}

Similarly \textbf{growth rate in basal area} can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq3}
\underbrace{{\color{cyan}\frac{da_{st}}{dt}}}_{\text{basal area growth rate}} = \underbrace{\frac{da_{ss}}{da_{l}}}_{\text{sapwood area per leaf area}} \times {\color{orange}\frac{da_{l}}{dm_{t}}} \times  {\color{blue}\frac{dm_t}{db}} \times {\color{green}\frac{db}{dt}} +  \underbrace{ k_{s} a_s }_{\text{sapwood turnover}}.
\end{equation}

The \textbf{growth rate in diameter} is then given by the geometric relationship between diameter and area applied to stem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq4}
\underbrace{\frac{dD}{dt}}_{\text{growth rate in diameter}} = \sqrt[]{\frac{\Pi}{a_{st}}} \times {\color{cyan}\frac{da_{st}}{dt}}.
\end{equation}

For the case of seedlings, eqs. \ref{eq:eq0}-\ref{eq:eq1} can be simplified considerably. Turnover of all tissues and allocation to reproduction have not yet begun. It is also common to assume all respiration rates are proportional to leaf area. Biomass growth rate in seedling then becomes a linear function of leaf area:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq1_seedlings}
{\color{magenta}\frac{dm_t}{dt}}  \approx  a_{l} \, y \, (A_{\textrm{area}} - r_{l}).
\end{equation}

The \textbf{relative growth rate in mass} $(\textrm{RGR}_{\textrm{mass}})$ in seedlings can be obtained by dividing both sides of this simplified eq \ref{eq:eq1_seedlings} by the total mass of living tissues $m_{t}$. The outcome is equivalent to the classical partitioning of RGR \citep{Lambers:1992bj, Cornelissen:1998ta}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq1_seedlings_RGR}
\textrm{RGR}_{\textrm{mass}}  \approx \textrm{NAR} \times  \textrm{SLA} \times  \textrm{LMF},
\end{equation}
 where net assimilation rate NAR=$y \, (A_{\textrm{area}} - r)$, SLA = $a_{l}/ m_{l}$ and leaf mass fraction LMF = $m_{l}/ m_{t}$.


The predicted effects of different traits on growth can then be understood by considering the influence of trait variation on elements of equations  \ref{eq:eq0}-\ref{eq:eq1_seedlings_RGR} (see Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}) and how these may interact with plant size.


\textbf{Specific leaf area (SLA):} For seedlings (eq. \ref{eq:eq1_seedlings_RGR}), cheaper leaf construction (high SLA) should translate directly into faster relative growth rate in mass. For larger plants (eq. \ref{eq:eq1}-\ref{eq:eq4}), SLA is expected to affect growth rate positively through more cost-efficient deployment of leaf area (via $da_l/dm_t$; the same effect as in seedlings), but also negatively via increased leaf turnover (eqn 1; Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}). The effect of SLA on $da_l/dm_t$ decreases as plant size increases and increasing amounts of the plant are wood. Consequently the effect of turnover costs in slowing growth comes to dominate at larger sizes.

\textbf{Wood density (WD):} Cheaper stem construction (low WD or stem density) increases the marginal rate of leaf deployment per total mass increment ($da_l/dm_t$), and consequently increases growth rate in leaf area, height and diameter (eqs. \ref{eq:eq2}-\ref{eq:eq4}; Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}). Disadvantages associated with cheap stem construction take the form of higher mortality and so are not reflected in growth equations. Under this scenario, wood density is negatively correlated to growth rate across all plant stages. Because the relative expenditure on stem compared to leaf is increases as plants grow larger, the relationship between WD and growth may also strengthen in larger plants.

\textbf{Maximum height (Hmax):} Hmax affects growth via the fraction of energy allocated to vegetative growth versus to seed production ($dm_t/db$ in eq. \ref{eq:eq1}; Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}). For juveniles and seedlings this fraction is 1 for all species and so no effect is expected. But once some species begin to produce seed, then species closer to their Hmax value are expected to be allocating more to seed production and less to vegetative growth. Hence when comparing across plants at a given size, species with smaller Hmax are expected to show slower vegetative growth rates.

\textbf{Seed mass:} The $\textrm{RGR}_{\textrm{mass}}$ slows as plants grow larger, and large-seeded species begin larger as seedlings. For larger plants, seed mass is not expected to have any distinct influence on growth rates  (Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}).

\textbf{Aarea:} The effects of benefits (higher assimilation) and costs (higher respiration) of increased Area occur within the same element of eq. \ref{eq:eq0}, and assimilation must outweigh respiration for there to be growth, so the net effect will be positive (Table \ref{tab:trade-offs}).

Note that the predicted relationship between growth and either SLA or seed mass in seedlings differs if absolute growth rate in mass is used instead of $RGR_{mass}$ (i.e. becomes negative for SLA, positive for SM). In our study, all data recorded for these trait-stage combinations have been measured on a RGR base for mass (see Fig S9).

Nevertheless, the characteristic shape of funnel plots is observed, with correlations involving few species showing much wider variation even though within-species replication was sometimes high. The open points correspond to the estimated missing studies. The number of missing values is 9 for SLA,1 for WD, 0 for Hmax, 6 for Seedmass and 0 for Aarea}

\section{Supporting Analyses}\label{app:supp_info_analyses}
\subsection{Quantifying and exploring the cause of heterogeneity in effect sizes}

\textbf{Goal:} In our meta-analysis, studies reported differed in design as well as in vegetation types, biome or species studied. Such diversity is commonly referred as methodological heterogeneity, and may or may not be responsible for observed discrepancies in the results of the studies. The extent of heterogeneity might influence the results of the meta-analysis, and then induces some difficulty in drawing overall conclusions (See \citealt{Higgins:2002iq}). It is therefore important to be able to quantify the extent of heterogeneity among a collection of studies.

\textbf{Methods:} A common way of addressing the extent of heterogeneity is the statistic $I^{2}$ (\citealt{Santos:2012gt}, originally defined by \citealt{Higgins:2002iq}). $I^{2}$ estimates the consistency of the results obtained from published studies used in our meta-analysis; it describes the percentage of variability in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. It can be interpreted as a ratio (0\% < $I^{2}$ < 100\%) not affected by the number of studies or the metric of the effect size in the analysis. It also has the advantage of being analogous to indices used for regression (where R2 is the proportion of the total variance that can be explained by the covariates) a common statistics in the trait literature.

An $I^{2}$ near zero indicates that almost all of the dispersion will be attributed to random error, and any attempt to explain the variance is an attempt to explain something that is (by definition) random. By contrast, as $I^{2}$ moves away from zero we know that some of the variance is real and can potentially be explained by subgroup analysis or meta-regression.
No universal rule could cover definition for ‘low, ‘moderate’ or ‘high heterogeneity. \citealt{Higgins:2003hz} suggested some benchmarks for $I^{2}$ based on the survey of meta-analyses of clinical trials. They suggested that values on the order of 25\%, 50\% and 75\% might be considered as ``low'', ``moderate'' and ``high'', respectively. These suggestions are tentative; the interpretation of heterogeneity in a systematic review will depend critically on the size and direction of treatment effects, as well as on considerations of methodological diversity in the studies (see \citealt{Borenstein:2009um}).
Here, we estimated $I^{2}$ as following equation from \citealt{Higgins:2002iq}., then we calculated how part of the heterogeneity may be due to the influence of moderators (stage and publication year) and finally we asked if the residual heterogeneity is statistically significant. In R, we used the package metafor (code available on guithub).


\textbf{Results:} We observed high levels of heterogeneity for all traits (SLA :$I^{2}$ 85.4\% CI: 80.9 to 92.1, WD :$I^{2}$ 61.8\% CI: 42.8 to 84.1, Hmax: $I^{2}$ 81.2\% CI: 69.8 to 93.4, Seedmass: $I^{2}$ 91.2\%, 85.9 to 96.1, Aarea: $I^{2}$ 68.3\% CI: 33.7 to 90.1) which suggests that the correlations coefficient r between growth and traits are not uniform across the range of studies investigated. This result suggested that a large part of the variance is not explained by sample error.

For SLA and Seedmass, 50.1\% and 20\% respectively of the total amount of heterogeneity were accounted by including the stage as a moderator. For the other traits, the stage explained few or no part of the heterogeneity observed across studies (<5\%). These results were consistent with our expectations about a shift in the relationship between growth and traits along plant size for SLA, Seed mass and the absence of effect for WD and Aarea (see Theoretical expectation section). The result of Hmax was more ambigus since we expected the relationship between asymptotic maximum height (Hmax) and growth rate to be absent in seedlings but to strengthen with increasing plant size (at adult stage). As discussed in the result section of the article, the smaller numbers of replicate studies for sapling and seedling stage limited the generality of our conclusion for this trait.

The test for residual heterogeneity was significant for all traits, possibly indicating that others moderators not considered in the model were influencing the correlation between growth and trait. This result is not surprising for the trait literature. While the trait and growth measurements are standardized \citep{Cornelissen:2003gw}, studies differed largely in their design as well as in vegetation types, biome or species studied. Indeed, a goal in the trait literature is to establish general pattern about correlation between growth and traits and to validate them across a large variation of conditions. Here, we did not explore the influence of other moderators, since our goal was to test clear hypotheses about the influence of plant size/stage, not to establish the best predictor of the correlation between growth and trait. Finally, since between study variation is significant, as indicated by heterogeneity analyses, using the random effect model was more appropriate in our meta-analysis.

\subsection{Testing for publication bias}
\textbf{Goal:} Studies with significant results are more likely to be published. As a consequence, the studies in a meta-analysis may overestimate the true effect size because they are based on a biased sample of the target population of studies. A publication bias occurs when the probability of publication depends on the statistical significance of the effect. Here we tested if there is an evidence of any bias, and if the effect size observed for each trait is an artefact of this biais.

\textbf{Method:} We first checked the dataset for publication bias with a visual assessment of funnel plots. A publication bias toward significant results creates an asymmetric funnel with small studies with non-significant effects missing from the mouth of the funnel on the side opposite to the true effect. While funnel plot are recommended to aid interpretation, there is a high risk failing to detect actual publication bias (see (\citealt{Koricheva:2013tz}) by using exclusively a visual assessment. In addition, funnel plots are not effective when the number of studies is small (<30) such as for Aarea and Seed mass.
We also used the ‘trim and fill’ method to estimate the number of studies missing from our meta-analyse. This method adjusts for funnel plot asymmetry \citep{Duval:2000dg}.
Finally, we estimated the number of studies needed to overturn a result, using the Rosenberg’s fail-safe number \citep{Rosenberg:2005hk}. The fail-safe N is not based on funnel plot asymmetry. The Rosenberg method calculates the number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to the given set of observed outcomes to reduce significance level (p-value) of the weighted average effect \citep{Rosenberg:2005hk}. A significant meta-analytic result is robust if the fail-safe N is greater than 5k+10, where k is the number or studies already in the meta-analysis \citep{Rosenthal:1979do}.
In R, we used the package metafor (code available on guithub).

\textbf{Result:} As expected the correlation coefficient varied less widely as sample size increased (funnel plots in Fig. \ref{FigA9}). Funnel plots exhibited a typical funnel shape for all five functional traits analyzed, showing no evidence for publication bias (Fig. \ref{FigA9}).
The ‘trim and fill’ method detected some missing values in our data. The estimated number of missing value ranges from 0 to 9 depending on the trait considered (Fig. \ref{FigA9}). The overall estimates measured with the fill in data changed from 0.5 ±0.07 to 0.4 ±0.07 for SLA and from -0.48±0.11 to -0.32±0.12 for the seed mass, suggesting a lower correlation coefficient for SLA, and Seedmass. Even if the estimated correlation were closest from zero with the missing studied filled in, the results still indicate that the effect is statistically significant.
The Rosenberg’s Fail-safe N are 7086, 1823, 990, 574, 291 for SLA, WD, Hmax, Seedmass and A area, suggesting that there would need to be over a large number of studies with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 added to the analysis before the cumulative correlation would become non significant. N is greater than 5k+10 for all traits.
All together these result suggest that the impact of bias is probably trivial in our meta-analyses.

\subsection{Exploring temporal changes in effect size}
\textbf{Goal:} Our meta-analysis combines data from studies published between 1983 and 2014. It has been shown that the magnitude of the effect size may changes over time due to a publication bias (i.e. a lag to publish negative results), a change in the methodology or biological changes in the magnitude of the effect (see \citealt{Koricheva:2013hy}). Therefore, detecting such temporal changes may be important to the interpretation of the results of a meta-analysis.

\textbf{Method:} In the trait literature the year of publication may be confounded with a methodological change. Indeed, in the early 90’s studies mainly focused on seedlings, whereas today a broader range of plant size/stage are studied (Fig. \ref{FigA9}). As a consequence, we used publication year as a moderator in our analyses \citep{Zvereva:2008jm}p across and within stages for all traits.

\textbf{Results:} There was a change in the effect size with publication year for SLA (pvalue<0.0001, estimates: -0.04 ±0.009), Seed mass (pvalue =0.011, estimates: 0.041 ±0.016) and Aarea (pvalue=0.0102, estimates: -0.0453± 0.0176). The Fig. \ref{FigA9} showed that for these 3 traits the publication years may be confounded with plant stage; the correlation coefficients have been reported from 1993, but studies started to report data on adult stage only 10 years later (around 2000-2007).

For SLA and Seed mass, a publication year effect was not observed within seedling and sapling stages, but was identified for the adult stage (SLA pvalue=0.003, Seedmass pvalue=0.06). For both SLA and Seedmass, the magnitude of the effect size decreased with publication year (Fig. \ref{FigA9} a and d), suggesting we overestimated the magnitude of the effect size for these two traits.  In reality, the main effect size obtained would be more close to zero or more negative for SLA and more positive for Seedmass. These results are consistent with our hypotheses; we expected a negative or non-significant effect of SLA on growth in adult stage, and a non-significant or positive effect of Seed mass on plant growth (see theoretical expectation).

For Aarea, publication year explained a part of the variation across stage but not within stage, and the magnitude of the effect size decreased with publication year. This pattern is classic in meta-analyses; \citealt{Koricheva:2013hy} showed that a majority of studies reported a decrease rather than an increase in the magnitude of effect size with publication year.  Yet, here this effect did not lead to a loss of the statistical significance of the main effect size or to a change of sign. While overestimated, the main effect size for the correlation between growth and Aarea stay positive  (Fig. \ref{FigA9} e).

The temporal change were confounded with a plant stage effect in our meta-analyse, but they did not jeopardizing the stability of our conclusions. The conclusions of a meta-analyses conducted in different year may not differ from the one reported here.
